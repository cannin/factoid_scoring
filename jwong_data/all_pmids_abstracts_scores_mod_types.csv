30415948,"DNA methylation and H3K9me are hallmarks of heterochromatin in plants and mammals, and are successfully maintained across generations. The biochemical and structural basis for this maintenance is poorly understood. The maintenance DNA methyltransferase from Zea mays, ZMET2, recognizes dimethylation of H3K9 via a chromodomain (CD) and a bromo adjacent homology (BAH) domain, which flank the catalytic domain. Here, we show that dinucleosomes are the preferred ZMET2 substrate, with DNA methylation preferentially targeted to linker DNA. Electron microscopy shows one ZMET2 molecule bridging two nucleosomes within a dinucleosome. We find that the CD stabilizes binding, whereas the BAH domain enables allosteric activation by the H3K9me mark. ZMET2 further couples recognition of H3K9me to an increase in the specificity for hemimethylated versus unmethylated DNA. We propose a model in which synergistic coupling between recognition of nucleosome spacing, H3K9 methylation, and DNA modification allows ZMET2 to maintain DNA methylation in heterochromatin with high fidelity.",0,0.0,{}
30449724,"Efforts to battle antimicrobial resistance (AMR) are generally focused on developing novel antibiotics. However, history shows that resistance arises regardless of the nature or potency of new drugs. Here, we propose and provide evidence for an alternate strategy to resolve this problem: inhibiting evolution. We determined that the DNA translocase Mfd is an ""evolvability factor"" that promotes mutagenesis and is required for rapid resistance development to all antibiotics tested across highly divergent bacterial species. Importantly, hypermutator alleles that accelerate AMR development did not arise without Mfd, at least during evolution of trimethoprim resistance. We also show that Mfd's role in AMR development depends on its interactions with the RNA polymerase subunit RpoB and the nucleotide excision repair protein UvrA. Our findings suggest that AMR development can be inhibited through inactivation of evolvability factors (potentially with ""anti-evolution"" drugs)-in particular, Mfd-providing an unexplored route toward battling the AMR crisis.",0,0.0,{}
30449725,"The genome is organized into topologically associated domains (TADs) that enclose smaller subTADs. Here, we identify and characterize an enhancer that is located in the middle of the V gene region of the immunoglobulin kappa light chain (Igκ) locus that becomes active preceding the stage at which this locus undergoes V(D)J recombination. This enhancer is a hub of long-range chromatin interactions connecting subTADs in the V gene region with the recombination center at the J genes. Deletion of this element results in a highly altered long-range chromatin interaction pattern across the locus and, importantly, affects individual V gene utilization locus-wide. These results indicate the existence of an enhancer-dependent framework in the Igκ locus and further suggest that the composition of the diverse antibody repertoire is regulated in a subTAD-specific manner. This enhancer thus plays a structural role in orchestrating the proper folding of the Igκ locus in preparation for V(D)J recombination.",0,0.0,{}
30472187,"The post-translational modification of key residues at the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II (RNAP2-CTD) coordinates transcription, splicing, and RNA processing by modulating its capacity to act as a landing platform for a variety of protein complexes. Here, we identify a new modification at the CTD, the deimination of arginine and its conversion to citrulline by peptidyl arginine deiminase 2 (PADI2), an enzyme that has been associated with several diseases, including cancer. We show that, among PADI family members, only PADI2 citrullinates R1810 (Cit1810) at repeat 31 of the CTD. Depletion of PADI2 or loss of R1810 results in accumulation of RNAP2 at transcription start sites, reduced gene expression, and inhibition of cell proliferation. Cit1810 is needed for interaction with the P-TEFb (positive transcription elongation factor b) kinase complex and for its recruitment to chromatin. In this way, CTD-Cit1810 favors RNAP2 pause release and efficient transcription in breast cancer cells.",0,0.0,{}
30472188,"The transcriptional regulators YAP and TAZ play important roles in development, physiology, and tumorigenesis and are negatively controlled by the Hippo pathway. It is yet unknown why the YAP/ TAZ proteins are frequently activated in human malignancies in which the Hippo pathway is still active. Here, by a gain-of-function cancer metastasis screen, we discovered OTUB2 as a cancer stemness and metastasis-promoting factor that deubiquitinates and activates YAP/TAZ. We found OTUB2 to be poly-SUMOylated on lysine 233, and this SUMOylation enables it to bind YAP/TAZ. We also identified a yet-unknown SUMO-interacting motif (SIM) in YAP and TAZ required for their association with SUMOylated OTUB2. Importantly, EGF and oncogenic KRAS induce OTUB2 poly-SUMOylation and thereby activate YAP/TAZ. Our results establish OTUB2 as an essential modulator of YAP/TAZ and also reveal a novel mechanism via which YAP/TAZ activity is induced by oncogenic KRAS.",6,18.0,"{""Sumoylation"": 2, ""Activation"": 4}"
30472189,"Recent studies have indicated that nucleosome turnover is rapid, occurring several times per cell cycle. To access the effect of nucleosome turnover on the epigenetic landscape, we investigated H3K79 methylation, which is produced by a single methyltransferase (Dot1l) with no known demethylase. Using chemical-induced proximity (CIP), we find that the valency of H3K79 methylation (mono-, di-, and tri-) is determined by nucleosome turnover rates. Furthermore, propagation of this mark is predicted by nucleosome turnover simulations over the genome and accounts for the asymmetric distribution of H3K79me toward the transcriptional unit. More broadly, a meta-analysis of other conserved histone modifications demonstrates that nucleosome turnover models predict both valency and chromosomal propagation of methylation marks. Based on data from worms, flies, and mice, we propose that the turnover of modified nucleosomes is a general means of propagation of epigenetic marks and a determinant of methylation valence.",1,1.5,"{""Methylation"": 1}"
30472190,"Transcription initiation requires opening of promoter DNA in the RNA polymerase II (Pol II) pre-initiation complex (PIC), but it remains unclear how this is achieved. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopic (cryo-EM) structure of a yeast PIC that contains underwound, distorted promoter DNA in the closed Pol II cleft. The DNA duplex axis is offset at the upstream edge of the initially melted DNA region (IMR) where DNA opening begins. Unstable IMRs are found in a subset of yeast promoters that we show can still initiate transcription after depletion of the transcription factor (TF) IIH (TFIIH) translocase Ssl2 (XPB in human) from the nucleus in vivo. PIC-induced DNA distortions may thus prime the IMR for melting and may explain how unstable IMRs that are predicted in promoters of Pol I and Pol III can open spontaneously. These results suggest that DNA distortion in the polymerase cleft is a general mechanism that contributes to promoter opening.",1,1.5,"{""Activation"": 1}"
30472191,"Cell dormancy is a widespread mechanism used by bacteria to evade environmental threats, including antibiotics. Here we monitored bacterial antibiotic tolerance and regrowth at the single-cell level and found that each individual survival cell shows different ""dormancy depth,"" which in return regulates the lag time for cell resuscitation after removal of antibiotic. We further established that protein aggresome-a collection of endogenous protein aggregates-is an important indicator of bacterial dormancy depth, whose formation is promoted by decreased cellular ATP level. For cells to leave the dormant state and resuscitate, clearance of protein aggresome and recovery of proteostasis are required. We revealed that the ability to recruit functional DnaK-ClpB machineries, which facilitate protein disaggregation in an ATP-dependent manner, determines the lag time for bacterial regrowth. Better understanding of the key factors regulating bacterial regrowth after surviving antibiotic attack could lead to new therapeutic strategies for combating bacterial antibiotic tolerance.",1,0.0,"{""Inhibition"": 1}"
30472192,"Since its establishment in 2009, single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has been a major driver behind progress in biomedical research. In developmental biology and stem cell studies, the ability to profile single cells confers particular benefits. Although most studies still focus on individual tissues or organs, the recent development of ultra-high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq has demonstrated potential power in characterizing more complex systems or even the entire body. However, although multiple ultra-high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq systems have attracted attention, no systematic comparison of these systems has been performed. Here, with the same cell line and bioinformatics pipeline, we developed directly comparable datasets for each of three widely used droplet-based ultra-high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq systems, inDrop, Drop-seq, and 10X Genomics Chromium. Although each system is capable of profiling single-cell transcriptomes, their detailed comparison revealed the distinguishing features and suitable applications for each system.",0,0.0,{}
30503770,"Mutations that lead to splicing defects can have severe consequences on gene function and cause disease. Here, we explore how human genetic variation affects exon recognition by developing a multiplexed functional assay of splicing using Sort-seq (MFASS). We assayed 27,733 variants in the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) within or adjacent to 2,198 human exons in the MFASS minigene reporter and found that 3.8% (1,050) of variants, most of which are extremely rare, led to large-effect splice-disrupting variants (SDVs). Importantly, we find that 83% of SDVs are located outside of canonical splice sites, are distributed evenly across distinct exonic and intronic regions, and are difficult to predict a priori. Our results indicate extant, rare genetic variants can have large functional effects on splicing at appreciable rates, even outside the context of disease, and MFASS enables their empirical assessment at scale.",0,0.0,{}
30503771,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are loaded into the Argonaute subfamily of proteins (AGO) to form an effector complex that silences target genes. Empty but not miRNA-loaded AGO is selectively degraded across species. However, the mechanism and biological significance of selective AGO degradation remain unclear. We discovered a RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase we named Iruka (Iru), which selectively ubiquitinates the empty form of Drosophila Ago1 to trigger its degradation. Iru preferentially binds empty Ago1 and ubiquitinates Lys514 in the L2 linker, which is predicted to be inaccessible in the miRNA-loaded state. Depletion of Iru results in global impairment of miRNA-mediated silencing of target genes and in the accumulation of aberrant Ago1 that is dysfunctional for canonical protein-protein interactions and miRNA loading. Our findings reveal a sophisticated mechanism for the selective degradation of empty AGO that underlies a quality control process to ensure AGO function.",4,9.0,"{""Complex"": 1, ""Ubiquitination"": 3}"
30503772,"Levels of the ribosome, the conserved molecular machine that mediates translation, are tightly linked to cellular growth rate. In humans, ribosomopathies are diseases associated with cell-type-specific pathologies and reduced ribosomal protein (RP) levels. Because gene expression defects resulting from ribosome deficiency have not yet been experimentally defined, we systematically probed mRNA, translation, and protein signatures that were either unlinked from or linked to cellular growth rate in RP-deficient yeast cells. Ribosome deficiency was associated with altered translation of gene subclasses, and profound general secondary effects of RP loss on the spectrum of cellular mRNAs were seen. Among these effects, growth-defective 60S mutants increased synthesis of proteins involved in proteasome-mediated degradation, whereas 40S mutants accumulated mature 60S subunits and increased translation of ribosome biogenesis genes. These distinct signatures of protein synthesis suggest intriguing and currently mysterious differences in the cellular consequences of deficiency for small and large ribosomal subunits.",1,0.0,"{""Activation"": 1}"
30503773,"Type ΙΙΙ CRISPR-Cas systems provide robust immunity against foreign RNA and DNA by sequence-specific RNase and target RNA-activated sequence-nonspecific DNase and RNase activities. We report on cryo-EM structures of Thermococcus onnurineus CsmcrRNA binary, CsmcrRNA-target RNA and CsmcrRNA-target RNAanti-tag ternary complexes in the 3.1 Å range. The topological features of the crRNA 5'-repeat tag explains the 5'-ruler mechanism for defining target cleavage sites, with accessibility of positions -2 to -5 within the 5'-repeat serving as sensors for avoidance of autoimmunity. The Csm3 thumb elements introduce periodic kinks in the crRNA-target RNA duplex, facilitating cleavage of the target RNA with 6-nt periodicity. Key Glu residues within a Csm1 loop segment of CsmcrRNA adopt a proposed autoinhibitory conformation suggestive of DNase activity regulation. These structural findings, complemented by mutational studies of key intermolecular contacts, provide insights into CsmcrRNA complex assembly, mechanisms underlying RNA targeting and site-specific periodic cleavage, regulation of DNase cleavage activity, and autoimmunity suppression.",0,0.0,{}
30503774,"Adaptive immune systems must accurately distinguish between self and non-self in order to defend against invading pathogens while avoiding autoimmunity. Type III CRISPR-Cas systems employ guide RNA to recognize complementary RNA targets, which triggers the degradation of both the invader's transcripts and their template DNA. These systems can broadly eliminate foreign targets with multiple mutations but circumvent damage to the host genome. To explore the molecular basis for these features, we use single-molecule fluorescence microscopy to study the interaction between a type III-A ribonucleoprotein complex and various RNA substrates. We find that Cas10-the DNase effector of the complex-displays rapid conformational fluctuations on foreign RNA targets, but is locked in a static configuration on self RNA. Target mutations differentially modulate Cas10 dynamics and tune the CRISPR interference activity in vivo.

30503775,"In addition to phosphodiester bond formation, RNA polymerase II has an RNA endonuclease activity, stimulated by TFIIS, which rescues complexes that have arrested and backtracked. How TFIIS affects transcription under normal conditions is poorly understood. We identified backtracking sites in human cells using a dominant-negative TFIIS (TFIISDN) that inhibits RNA cleavage and stabilizes backtracked complexes. Backtracking is most frequent within 2 kb of start sites, consistent with slow elongation early in transcription, and in 3' flanking regions where termination is enhanced by TFIISDN, suggesting that backtracked pol II is a favorable substrate for termination. Rescue from backtracking by RNA cleavage also promotes escape from 5' pause sites, prevents premature termination of long transcripts, and enhances activation of stress-inducible genes. TFIISDN slowed elongation rates genome-wide by half, suggesting that rescue of backtracked pol II by TFIIS is a major stimulus of elongation under normal conditions.",1,1.5,"{""Activation"": 1}"
30527540,"In Parkinson's disease (PD), α-synuclein (αS) pathologically impacts the brain, a highly lipid-rich organ. We investigated how alterations in αS or lipid/fatty acid homeostasis affect each other. Lipidomic profiling of human αS-expressing yeast revealed increases in oleic acid (OA, 18:1), diglycerides, and triglycerides. These findings were recapitulated in rodent and human neuronal models of αS dyshomeostasis (overexpression; patient-derived triplication or E46K mutation; E46K mice). Preventing lipid droplet formation or augmenting OA increased αS yeast toxicity; suppressing the OA-generating enzyme stearoyl-CoA-desaturase (SCD) was protective. Genetic or pharmacological SCD inhibition ameliorated toxicity in αS-overexpressing rat neurons. In a C. elegans model, SCD knockout prevented αS-induced dopaminergic degeneration. Conversely, we observed detrimental effects of OA on αS homeostasis: in human neural cells, excess OA caused αS inclusion formation, which was reversed by SCD inhibition. Thus, monounsaturated fatty acid metabolism is pivotal for αS-induced neurotoxicity, and inhibiting SCD represents a novel PD therapeutic approach.",0,0.0,{}
30527661,"In Drosophila, 23-30 nt long PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) direct the protein Piwi to silence germline transposon transcription. Most germline piRNAs derive from dual-strand piRNA clusters, heterochromatic transposon graveyards that are transcribed from both genomic strands. These piRNA sources are marked by the heterochromatin protein 1 homolog Rhino (Rhi), which facilitates their promoter-independent transcription, suppresses splicing, and inhibits transcriptional termination. Here, we report that the protein Maelstrom (Mael) represses canonical, promoter-dependent transcription in dual-strand clusters, allowing Rhi to initiate piRNA precursor transcription. Mael also represses promoter-dependent transcription at sites outside clusters. At some loci, Mael repression requires the piRNA pathway, while at others, piRNAs play no role. We propose that by repressing canonical transcription of individual transposon mRNAs, Mael helps Rhi drive non-canonical transcription of piRNA precursors without generating mRNAs encoding transposon proteins.",6,9.0,"{""Inhibition"": 2, ""Activation"": 2, ""DecreaseAmount"": 2}"
30527662,"Metazoan chromosomes are sequentially partitioned into topologically associating domains (TADs) and then into smaller sub-domains. One class of sub-domains, insulated neighborhoods, are proposed to spatially sequester and insulate the enclosed genes through self-association and chromatin looping. However, it has not been determined functionally whether promoter-enhancer interactions and gene regulation are broadly restricted to within these loops. Here, we employed published datasets from murine embryonic stem cells (mESCs) to identify insulated neighborhoods that confine promoter-enhancer interactions and demarcate gene regulatory regions. To directly address the functionality of these regions, we depleted estrogen-related receptor β (Esrrb), which binds the Mediator co-activator complex, to impair enhancers of genes within 222 insulated neighborhoods without causing mESC differentiation. Esrrb depletion reduces Mediator binding, promoter-enhancer looping, and expression of both nascent RNA and mRNA within the insulated neighborhoods without significantly affecting the flanking genes. Our data indicate that insulated neighborhoods represent functional regulons in mammalian genomes.",1,1.5,"{""Complex"": 1}"

Here, we report a new post-transcriptional pathway regulating autophagy involving the Pat1-Lsm (Lsm1 to Lsm7) mRNA-binding complex. Under nitrogen-starvation conditions, Pat1-Lsm binds a specific subset of autophagy-related (ATG) transcripts and prevents their 3' to 5' degradation by the exosome complex, leading to ATG mRNA stabilization and accumulation. This process is regulated through Pat1 dephosphorylation, is necessary for the efficient expression of specific Atg proteins, and is required for robust autophagy induction during nitrogen starvation.

Here we show that Ego1, which mediates membrane-anchoring of EGOC via lipid modifications that it acquires while traveling through the trans-Golgi network, is separately sorted to vacuoles and perivacuolar endosomes. At both surfaces, it assembles EGOCs, which regulate spatially distinct pools of TORC1 that impinge on functionally divergent effectors: vacuolar TORC1 predominantly targets Sch9 to promote protein synthesis, whereas endosomal TORC1 phosphorylates Atg13 and Vps27 to inhibit macroautophagy and ESCRT-driven microautophagy, respectively.

The retinoblastoma protein RB is a tumor suppressor known to regulate the cell cycle, DNA damage response, and differentiation. Here, we demonstrate that RB interacts with nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) protein p65 and that their interaction is primarily dependent on CDK4/6-mediated serine-249/threonine-252 (S249/T252) phosphorylation of RB. RNA-seq analysis shows a subset of NF-κB pathway genes including PD-L1 are selectively upregulated by RB knockdown or CDK4/6 inhibitor. S249/T252-phosphorylated RB inversely correlates with PD-L1 expression in patient samples. Expression of a RB-derived S249/T252 phosphorylation-mimetic peptide suppresses radiotherapy-induced upregulation of PD-L1 and augments therapeutic efficacy of radiation in vivo. Our findings reveal a previously unrecognized tumor suppressor function of hyperphosphorylated RB in suppressing NF-κB activity and PD-L1 expression and suggest that the RB-NF-κB axis can be exploited to overcome cancer immune evasion triggered by conventional or targeted therapies.",6,15.0,"{""Inhibition"": 2, ""Phosphorylation"": 1, ""Activation"": 2, ""DecreaseAmount"": 1}"

However, it remains unclear how changes in LIN28 expression define patterns of post-transcriptional gene regulation. Here we show that LIN28 expression level is a key variable that sets the magnitude of protein translation. By systematically varying LIN28B protein levels in human cells, we discovered a dose-dependent divergence in transcriptome-wide ribosome occupancy that enabled the formation of two discrete translational subpopulations composed of nearly all expressed genes. This bifurcation in gene expression was mediated by a redistribution in Argonaute association, from let-7 to non-let-7 microRNA families, resulting in a global shift in cellular miRNA activity. Post-transcriptional effects were scaled across the physiological LIN28 expression range.

Cohesin mediates sister chromatid cohesion, but this is not always perturbed in cancer cells. Here, we identify a previously unknown role for cohesin. We find that cohesin is required to repress transcription at DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Notably, cohesin represses transcription at DSBs throughout interphase, indicating that this is distinct from its known role in mediating DNA repair through sister chromatid cohesion. We identified a cancer-associated SA2 mutation that supports sister chromatid cohesion but is unable to repress transcription at DSBs. We further show that failure to repress transcription at DSBs leads to large-scale genome rearrangements. Cancer samples lacking SA2 display mutational patterns consistent with loss of this pathway.

To determine the composition of fragile particles, we introduce CUT&RUN.ChIP, in which targeted nuclease cleavage and release is followed by chromatin immunoprecipitation. We find that fragile particles represent the occupancy of the RSC (remodeling the structure of chromatin) nucleosome remodeling complex and RSC-bound, partially unwrapped nucleosomal intermediates. We also find that general regulatory factors (GRFs) bind to partially unwrapped nucleosomes at these promoters.

We find that precision of DNA editing (i.e., recurrence of a specific indel) varies considerably among sites, with some targets showing one highly preferred indel and others displaying numerous infrequent indels. Editing precision correlates with editing efficiency and a preference for single-nucleotide homologous insertions. Precise targets and editing outcome can be predicted based on simple rules that mainly depend on the fourth nucleotide upstream of the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM).

Biochemical studies have suggested that stimuli predominantly affect the rates of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) recruitment and polymerase release from promoter-proximal pausing. Single-cell studies revealed that transcription occurs in discontinuous bursts, suggesting that features of such bursts like frequency and intensity could also be regulated. We combined Pol II chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) and single-cell transcriptional measurements to show that an independently regulated burst initiation step is required before polymerase recruitment can occur.

By testing ∼40,000 pri-miRNA variants, we find that for some pri-miRNAs the cleavage site is dictated mainly by the mGHG motif embedded in the lower stem region of pri-miRNA. Structural modeling and deep-sequencing-based complementation experiments show that the double-stranded RNA-binding domain (dsRBD) of DROSHA recognizes mGHG to place the catalytic center in the appropriate position. The mGHG motif as well as the mGHG-recognizing residues in DROSHA dsRBD are conserved across eumetazoans, suggesting that this mechanism emerged in an early ancestor of the animal lineage.

This function requires the F-box domain of EMI1, through which EMI1 assembles a canonical SCF ubiquitin ligase complex that constitutively targets RAD51 for degradation. In response to genotoxic stress, CHK1-mediated phosphorylation of RAD51 counteracts EMI1-dependent degradation by enhancing RAD51's affinity for BRCA2, leading to RAD51 accumulation. Inhibition of RAD51 degradation restores HRR in BRCA1-depleted cells. Human breast cancer samples display an inverse correlation between EMI1 and RAD51 protein levels.

After division, healthy mitochondria restore MMP levels and participate in the fusion-fission cycle again, but mitochondria that fail to restore MMP undergo mitophagy.

Here, we demonstrate that mitochondria play a crucial role in cysteine-deprivation-induced ferroptosis but not in that induced by inhibiting glutathione peroxidase-4 (GPX4), the most downstream component of the ferroptosis pathway. Mechanistically, cysteine deprivation leads to mitochondrial membrane potential hyperpolarization and lipid peroxide accumulation. Inhibition of mitochondrial TCA cycle or electron transfer chain (ETC) mitigated mitochondrial membrane potential hyperpolarization, lipid peroxide accumulation, and ferroptosis. Blockage of glutaminolysis had the same inhibitory effect, which was counteracted by supplying downstream TCA cycle intermediates. Importantly, loss of function of fumarate hydratase, a tumor suppressor and TCA cycle component, confers resistance to cysteine-deprivation-induced ferroptosis. Collectively, this work demonstrates the crucial role of mitochondria in cysteine-deprivation-induced ferroptosis and implicates ferroptosis in tumor suppression.",1,0.0,"{""Activation"": 1}"

The interaction of PI3KC3 complex II and its ubiquitously expressed inhibitor, Rubicon, was mapped to the first β sheet of the BECN1 BARA domain and the UVRAG BARA2 domain by hydrogen-deuterium exchange and cryo-EM. These data suggest that the BARA β sheet 1 unfolds to directly engage the membrane. This mechanism was confirmed using protein engineering, giant unilamellar vesicle assays, and molecular simulations. Using this mechanism, a BECN1 β sheet-1 derived peptide activates both PI3KC3 complexes I and II, while HIV-1 Nef inhibits complex II. These data reveal how BECN1 switches on and off PI3KC3 binding to membranes. The observations explain how PI3KC3 inhibition by Rubicon, activation by autophagy-inducing BECN1 peptides, and inhibition by HIV-1 Nef are mediated by the switchable ability of the BECN1 BARA domain to partially unfold and insert into membranes.",2,3.0,"{""Inhibition"": 2}"

Strikingly, in contrast to canonical UPR signaling, Sema3A-induced eIF2α phosphorylation bypasses global translational repression and underlies an increase in local translation through differential activity of eIF2B mediated by protein phosphatase 1. Ultrasensitive proteomics analysis of axons reveals 75 proteins translationally controlled via the Sema3A-p-eIF2α pathway. These include proteostasis- and actin cytoskeleton-related proteins but not canonical stress markers.

Quiescence is essential for stem cell maintenance, and its misregulation is implicated in tumor formation. One of the hallmarks of quiescent cells is highly condensed chromatin. Because condensed chromatin often correlates with transcriptional silencing, it has been hypothesized that chromatin compaction represses transcription during quiescence. However, the technology to test this model by determining chromatin structure within cells at gene resolution has not previously been available. Here, we use Micro-C XL to map chromatin contacts at single-nucleosome resolution genome-wide in quiescent Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells. We describe chromatin domains on the order of 10-60 kilobases that, only in quiescent cells, are formed by condensin-mediated loops. Condensin depletion prevents the compaction of chromatin within domains and leads to widespread transcriptional de-repression.

Using Xenopus egg extracts that recapitulate replication-coupled DPC proteolysis, we show that DPCs can be degraded by SPRTN or the proteasome, which act as independent DPC proteases. Proteasome recruitment requires DPC polyubiquitylation, which is partially dependent on the ubiquitin ligase activity of TRAIP. In contrast, SPRTN-mediated DPC degradation does not require DPC polyubiquitylation but instead depends on nascent strand extension to within a few nucleotides of the lesion, implying that polymerase stalling at the DPC activates SPRTN on both leading and lagging strand templates.

We find that ripoptosome complexes progressively form as cells enter mitosis, peaking at metaphase and disassembling as cells exit mitosis. Genetic deletion and mitosis-specific inhibition of Ripk1 or Caspase-8 results in chromosome alignment defects independently of MLKL. We found that Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) is recruited into mitotic ripoptosomes, where PLK1's activity is controlled via RIPK1-dependent recruitment and Caspase-8-mediated cleavage.

In turn, cis cleavage of double-stranded DNA targets is a result of protospacer adjacent motif (PAM)-dependent DNA duplex unwinding, electrostatic stabilization of the displaced non-target DNA strand, and ordered sequential cleavage of the non-target and target DNA strands. Cas12a releases the PAM-distal DNA cleavage product and remains bound to the PAM-proximal DNA cleavage product in a catalytically competent, trans-active state.

In mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), CpG-rich developmental regulator genes are repressed by the Polycomb complexes PRC1 and PRC2. Here, we show that R-loops form at a subset of Polycomb target genes, and we investigate their contribution to Polycomb repression. At R-loop-positive genes, R-loop removal leads to decreased PRC1 and PRC2 recruitment and Pol II activation into a productive elongation state, accompanied by gene derepression at nascent and processed transcript levels. Stable removal of PRC2 derepresses R-loop-negative genes, as expected, but does not affect R-loops, PRC1 recruitment, or transcriptional repression of R-loop-positive genes. Our results highlight that Polycomb repression does not occur via one mechanism but consists of different layers of repression, some of which are gene specific.

All 14 mP-RBs interact with E2F/DP proteins, but they provide different shades of E2F regulation.

Interestingly, we found that topologically associating domains (TADs) undergo dissolution and reestablishment in spermatogenesis. Strikingly, pachytene spermatocytes, where synapsis occurs, are strongly depleted for TADs despite their active transcription state but uniquely show highly refined local compartments that alternate between transcribing and non-transcribing regions (refined-A/B). Importantly, such chromatin organization is conserved in mouse, where it remains largely intact upon transcription inhibition.

Here, we show that mRNA export factors generally facilitate usage of distal cleavage and polyadenylation sites (PASs), leading to long 3' UTR isoform expression. By focusing on the export receptor NXF1, which exhibits the most potent effect on APA in this study, we reveal several gene features that impact NXF1-dependent APA, including 3' UTR size, gene size, and AT content. Surprisingly, NXF1 downregulation results in RNA polymerase II (Pol II) accumulation at the 3' end of genes, correlating with its role in APA regulation. Moreover, NXF1 cooperates with CFI-68 to facilitate nuclear export of long 3' UTR isoform with UGUA motifs.

30824372,"DNA damage response (DDR) involves dramatic transcriptional alterations, the mechanisms of which remain ill defined. Here, we show that following genotoxic stress, the RNA-binding motif protein 7 (RBM7) stimulates RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription and promotes cell viability by activating the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) via its release from the inhibitory 7SK small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (7SK snRNP). This is mediated by activation of p38MAPK, which triggers enhanced binding of RBM7 with core subunits of 7SK snRNP. In turn, P-TEFb relocates to chromatin to induce transcription of short units, including key DDR genes and multiple classes of non-coding RNAs. Critically, interfering with the axis of RBM7 and P-TEFb provokes cellular hypersensitivity to DNA-damage-inducing agents due to activation of apoptosis.

By performing a comprehensive endogenous Xist deletion screen, we identify Repeat B as crucial for spreading Xist and maintaining Polycomb repressive complexes 1 and 2 (PRC1/PRC2) along the inactive X (Xi). Unexpectedly, spreading of these three factors is inextricably linked. Deleting Repeat B or its direct binding partner, HNRNPK, compromises recruitment of PRC1 and PRC2. In turn, ablating PRC1 or PRC2 impairs Xist spreading. Therefore, Xist and Polycomb complexes require each other to propagate along the Xi, suggesting a positive feedback mechanism between RNA initiator and protein effectors. Perturbing Xist/Polycomb spreading causes failure of de novo Xi silencing, with partial compensatory downregulation of the active X, and also disrupts topological Xi reconfiguration.

Loss of CHP1 severely reduces fatty acid incorporation and storage in mammalian cells and invertebrates. Mechanistically, CHP1 binds and activates GPAT4, which catalyzes the initial rate-limiting step in glycerolipid synthesis. GPAT4 activity requires CHP1 to be N-myristoylated, forming a key molecular interface between the two proteins.

One mechanism that triggers these errors is mitotic entry before the completion of DNA replication. To address how mitosis might affect DNA replication, we used Xenopus egg extracts. When mitotic CDK (Cyclin B1-CDK1) is used to drive interphase egg extracts into a mitotic state, the replicative CMG (CDC45/MCM2-7/GINS) helicase undergoes ubiquitylation on its MCM7 subunit, dependent on the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAIP. Whether replisomes have stalled or undergone termination, CMG ubiquitylation is followed by its extraction from chromatin by the CDC48/p97 ATPase. TRAIP-dependent CMG unloading during mitosis is also seen in C. elegans early embryos.

In contrast to oncogenic kinases, whose function is acutely regulated by transient phosphorylation, PKC is constitutively phosphorylated following biosynthesis to yield a stable, autoinhibited enzyme that is reversibly activated by second messengers. Here, we report that the phosphatase PHLPP1 opposes PKC phosphorylation during maturation, leading to the degradation of aberrantly active species that do not become autoinhibited. Cancer-associated hotspot mutations in the pseudosubstrate of PKCβ that impair autoinhibition result in dephosphorylated and unstable enzymes. Protein-level analysis reveals that PKCα is fully phosphorylated at the PHLPP site in over 5,000 patient tumors, with higher PKC levels correlating (1) inversely with PHLPP1 levels and (2) positively with improved survival in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Thus, PHLPP1 provides a proofreading step that maintains the fidelity of PKC autoinhibition and reveals a prominent loss-of-function mechanism in cancer by suppressing the steady-state levels of PKC.",0,0.0,{}

30905508,"V(D)J recombination is essential to generate antigen receptor diversity but is also a potent cause of genome instability. Many chromosome alterations that result from aberrant V(D)J recombination involve breaks at single recombination signal sequences (RSSs). A long-standing question, however, is how such breaks occur. Here, we show that the genomic DNA that is excised during recombination, the excised signal circle (ESC), forms a complex with the recombinase proteins to efficiently catalyze breaks at single RSSs both in vitro and in vivo. Following cutting, the RSS is released while the ESC-recombinase complex remains intact to potentially trigger breaks at further RSSs. Consistent with this, chromosome breaks at RSSs increase markedly in the presence of the ESC. Notably, these breaks co-localize with those found in acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients and occur at key cancer driver genes.

Here we reveal a dual role of RSC in cohesin loading. RSC acts as a chromatin receptor that recruits Scc2-Scc4 by a direct protein interaction independent of chromatin remodeling. In addition, chromatin remodeling is required to generate a nucleosome-free region that is the substrate for cohesin loading. An engineered cohesin loading module can be created by fusing the Scc2 C terminus to RSC or to other chromatin remodelers, but not to unrelated DNA binding proteins.

MYC directly binds SPT5, recruits SPT5 to promoters, and enables the CDK7-dependent transfer of SPT5 onto Pol II. Consistent with known functions of SPT5, MYC is required for fast and processive transcription elongation. Intriguingly, the high levels of MYC that are expressed in tumors sequester SPT5 into non-functional complexes, thereby decreasing the expression of growth-suppressive genes.

We demonstrate that HRSP12 functions as an adaptor to bridge YTHDF2 and RNase P/MRP, eliciting rapid degradation of YTHDF2-bound RNAs. Transcriptome-wide analyses show that m6A RNAs that are preferentially targeted for endoribonucleolytic cleavage have an HRSP12-binding site and a RNase P/MRP-directed cleavage site upstream and downstream of the YTHDF2-binding site, respectively. We also find that a subset of m6A-containing circular RNAs associates with YTHDF2 in an HRSP12-dependent manner and is selectively downregulated by RNase P/MRP.

These defects co-occur with a genome-wide delay in assembling DSB-promoting proteins on autosome axes and loss of a specialized PAR-axis domain that is highly enriched for DSB-promoting proteins in wild type. Thus, we propose a model for spatiotemporal patterning of recombination by ANKRD31-dependent control of axis-associated DSB-promoting proteins.",0,0.0,{}

We find that levels of mitochondrial protein succinylation and malonylation are high in BAT and subject to physiological and genetic regulation. BAT-specific deletion of Sirt5, a mitochondrial desuccinylase and demalonylase, results in dramatic increases in global protein succinylation and malonylation. Mass spectrometry-based quantification of succinylation reveals that Sirt5 regulates the key thermogenic protein in BAT, UCP1. Mutation of the two succinylated lysines in UCP1 to acyl-mimetic glutamine and glutamic acid significantly decreases its stability and activity. The reduced function of UCP1 and other proteins in Sirt5KO BAT results in impaired mitochondria respiration, defective mitophagy, and metabolic inflexibility.

Here we developed a chemoptogenetic tool that selectively produces 8-oxoG only at telomeres. Acute telomeric 8-oxoG formation increased telomere fragility in cells lacking OGG1, the enzyme that removes 8-oxoG, but did not compromise cell survival. However, chronic telomeric 8-oxoG induction over time shortens telomeres and impairs cell growth. Accumulation of telomeric 8-oxoG in chronically exposed OGG1-deficient cells triggers replication stress, as evidenced by mitotic DNA synthesis at telomeres, and significantly increases telomere losses.

We propose that the intramolecular stem-loop (ISL) of U6 exists in two competing states, changing between a default, non-catalytic conformation and a transient, catalytic conformation. Whereas stable interactions in the catalytic triplex promote catalysis and their disruptions favor exit from the catalytic conformation, destabilization of the lower ISL stem promotes catalysis and its stabilization supports exit from the catalytic conformation. Thus, in addition to the catalytic triplex, U6-ISL acts as an important dynamic component of the catalytic center. The relative flexibility of the lower U6-ISL stem is conserved across eukaryotes. Similar features are found in U6atac and domain V of group II introns, arguing for the generality of the proposed mechanism.",0,0.0,{}

Key to this process is the cells' ability to stabilize and restart stalled replication forks. Here, we show that the EXD2 nuclease is essential to this process. EXD2 recruitment to stressed forks suppresses their degradation by restraining excessive fork regression. Accordingly, EXD2 deficiency leads to fork collapse, hypersensitivity to replication inhibitors, and genomic instability. Impeding fork regression by inactivation of SMARCAL1 or removal of RECQ1's inhibition in EXD2-/- cells restores efficient fork restart and genome stability. Moreover, purified EXD2 efficiently processes substrates mimicking regressed forks. Thus, this work identifies a mechanism underpinned by EXD2's nuclease activity, by which cells balance fork regression with fork restoration to maintain genome stability.

Regulation occurs through a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM)-dependent interaction of Cas9 with its endogenous DNA targets, dependent on a non-canonical small RNA (scaRNA) and tracrRNA. The limited complementarity between scaRNA and the endogenous DNA targets precludes cleavage, highlighting the evolution of scaRNA to repress transcription without lethally targeting the chromosome.

In addition to its canonical role as a cytoplasmic histone H4 acetyltransferase, we isolated a HAT1-containing complex bound specifically at promoters of H4 genes. HAT1-dependent transcription of H4 genes required an acetate-sensitive promoter element.

These isoforms contain m6Am that maps to ""internal"" sites, increasing the likelihood of misannotation.

We have identified an alternative pathway for PARPi-mediated growth control in BRCA1/2-intact breast cancer cells involving rDNA transcription and ribosome biogenesis. PARP-1 binds to snoRNAs, which stimulate PARP-1 catalytic activity in the nucleolus independent of DNA damage. Activated PARP-1 ADP-ribosylates DDX21, an RNA helicase that localizes to nucleoli and promotes rDNA transcription when ADP-ribosylated. Treatment with PARPi or mutation of the ADP-ribosylation sites reduces DDX21 nucleolar localization, rDNA transcription, ribosome biogenesis, protein translation, and cell growth. The salient features of this pathway are evident in xenografts in mice and human breast cancer patient samples. Elevated levels of PARP-1 and nucleolar DDX21 are associated with cancer-related outcomes.

Yet, context-specific modifications must tailor the recombination machinery to avoid (mitosis) or enforce (meiosis) the formation of reciprocal exchanges-crossovers-between recombining chromosomes. To obtain molecular insight into how crossover control is achieved, we affinity purified 7 DNA-processing enzymes that channel HR intermediates into crossovers or noncrossovers from vegetative cells or cells undergoing meiosis. Using mass spectrometry, we provide a global characterization of their composition and reveal mitosis- and meiosis-specific modules in the interaction networks. Functional analyses of meiosis-specific interactors of MutLγ-Exo1 identified Rtk1, Caf120, and Chd1 as regulators of crossing-over. Chd1, which transiently associates with Exo1 at the prophase-to-metaphase I transition, enables the formation of MutLγ-dependent crossovers through its conserved ability to bind and displace nucleosomes.

When DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) occur, MRN is quickly recruited to the damage site and initiates DNA end resection; accordingly, MRE11 must be tightly regulated to avoid inefficient repair or nonspecific resection. Here, we show that MRE11 and RAD50 form a complex (MRC) with C1QBP, which stabilizes MRE11/RAD50, while inhibiting MRE11 nuclease activity by preventing its binding to DNA or chromatin. Upon DNA damage, ATM phosphorylates MRE11-S676/S678 to quickly dissociate the MRC complex. Either excess or insufficient C1QBP impedes the recruitment of MRE11 to DSBs and impairs the DNA damage response.

Here, we report structures of human Ago2 (hAgo2) bound to miRNAs and TDMD-inducing targets. miRNA and target form a bipartite duplex with an unpaired flexible linker. hAgo2 cannot physically accommodate the RNA, causing the duplex to bend at the linker and display the miRNA 3' end for enzymatic attack. Altering 3' end display by changing linker flexibility, changing 3' end complementarity, or mutationally inducing 3' end release impacts TDMD efficiency, leading to production of distinct 3'-miRNA isoforms in cells.

The oligomerization is induced when the ZZ domain of p62 is bound by the N-terminal arginine (Nt-Arg) of arginylated substrates. Upon activation by the Nt-Arg, oligomerized TRIM13-p62 complexes are separated along with the ER compartments and targeted to autophagosomes, leading to lysosomal degradation. When protein aggregates accumulate within the ER lumen, degradation-resistant autophagic cargoes are co-segregated by ER membranes for lysosomal degradation.

Although structural requirements of target degradation are emerging, mechanisms determining the cellular response to small-molecule degraders remain poorly understood. To systematically delineate effectors required for targeted protein degradation, we applied genome-scale CRISPR/Cas9 screens for five drugs that hijack different substrate receptors (SRs) of cullin RING ligases (CRLs) to induce target proteolysis. We found that sensitivity to small-molecule degraders is dictated by shared and drug-specific modulator networks, including the COP9 signalosome and the SR exchange factor CAND1. Genetic or pharmacologic perturbation of these effectors impairs CRL plasticity and arrests a wide array of ligases in a constitutively active state. Resulting defects in CRL decommissioning prompt widespread CRL auto-degradation that confers resistance to multiple degraders.

We therefore developed an RNA proximity labeling technique, APEX-seq, which uses the ascorbate peroxidase APEX2 to probe the spatial organization of the transcriptome. We show that APEX-seq can resolve the localization of RNAs within the cell and determine their enrichment or depletion near key RNA-binding proteins. Matching the spatial transcriptome, as revealed by APEX-seq, with the spatial proteome determined by APEX-mass spectrometry (APEX-MS), obtained precisely in parallel, provides new insights into the organization of translation initiation complexes on active mRNAs and unanticipated complexity in stress granule composition.

Critical to this control is SLX4IP, which accumulates at ALT telomeres and interacts with SLX4, XPF, and BLM. Loss of SLX4IP increases ALT-related phenotypes, which is incompatible with cell growth following concomitant loss of SLX4.

We find that hairpin opening occurs during EF-G-catalyzed translocation and is driven by the forward rotation of the small subunit head. Modulating the magnitude of the hairpin barrier by force shows that ribosomes respond to strong barriers by shifting their operation to an alternative 7-fold-slower kinetic pathway prior to translocation. Shifting into a slow gear results from an allosteric switch in the ribosome that may allow it to exploit thermal fluctuations to overcome mechanical barriers.

31522987,"Mammalian genomes are folded into topologically associating domains (TADs), consisting of chromatin loops anchored by CTCF and cohesin. Some loops are cell-type specific. Here we asked whether CTCF loops are established by a universal or locus-specific mechanism. Investigating the molecular determinants of CTCF clustering, we found that CTCF self-association in vitro is RNase sensitive and that an internal RNA-binding region (RBRi) mediates CTCF clustering and RNA interaction in vivo. Strikingly, deleting the RBRi impairs about half of all chromatin loops in mESCs and causes deregulation of gene expression. Disrupted loop formation correlates with diminished clustering and chromatin binding of RBRi mutant CTCF, which in turn results in a failure to halt cohesin-mediated extrusion. Thus, CTCF loops fall into at least two classes: RBRi-independent and RBRi-dependent loops. We speculate that evidence for RBRi-dependent loops may provide a molecular mechanism for establishing cell-specific CTCF loops, potentially regulated by RNA(s) or other RBRi-interacting partners.",0,0.0,{}

In this regard, we now report two independent features that disrupt CTCF association with chromatin: inhibition of transcription and disruption of CTCF-RNA interactions through mutations of 2 of its 11 zinc fingers that are not required for CTCF binding to its cognate DNA site: zinc finger 1 (ZF1) or zinc finger 10 (ZF10). These mutations alter gene expression profiles as CTCF mutants lose their ability to form chromatin loops and thus the ability to insulate chromatin domains and to mediate CTCF long-range genomic interactions.

U1-CPAFs are distinct from U1-spliceosomal complexes; they include CPA's three main subunits, CFIm, CPSF, and CstF; lack essential splicing factors; and associate with transcription elongation and mRNA export complexes. Telescripting requires U1:pre-mRNA base-pairing, which can be disrupted by U1 antisense oligonucleotide (U1 AMO), triggering PCPA. U1 AMO remodels U1-CPAFs, revealing changes, including recruitment of CPA-stimulating factors, that explain U1-CPAFs' switch from repressive to activated states.

Pre-rRNA processing factors, such as fibrillarin (FBL), form 18-24 clusters that further assemble into the DFC surrounding the FC. Mechanistically, the 5' end of nascent 47S pre-rRNA binds co-transcriptionally to the RNA-binding domain of FBL. FBL diffuses to the DFC, where local self-association via its glycine- and arginine-rich (GAR) domain forms phase-separated clusters to immobilize FBL-interacting pre-rRNA, thus promoting directional traffic of nascent pre-rRNA while facilitating pre-rRNA processing and DFC formation.

Rad52 helps assemble Rad51-ssDNA nucleoprotein filaments that catalyze DNA strand exchange, and it mediates single-strand DNA annealing. We find that Rad52 has an even earlier function in HR in restricting DNA double-stranded break ends resection that generates 3' single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) tails. In fission yeast, Exo1 is the primary resection nuclease, with the helicase Rqh1 playing a minor role. We demonstrate that the choice of two extensive resection pathways is regulated by Rad52. In rad52 cells, the resection rate increases from ∼3-5 kb/h up to ∼10-20 kb/h in an Rqh1-dependent manner, while Exo1 becomes dispensable. Budding yeast Rad52 similarly inhibits Sgs1-dependent resection. Single-molecule analysis with purified budding yeast proteins shows that Rad52 competes with Sgs1 for DNA end binding and inhibits Sgs1 translocation along DNA. These results identify a role for Rad52 in limiting ssDNA generated by end resection.",0,0.0,{}

Using semi-synthetic glutarylated histones, we show that an evolutionarily conserved Kglu at histone H4K91 destabilizes nucleosome in vitro. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the replacement of H4K91 by glutamate that mimics Kglu influences chromatin structure and thereby results in a global upregulation of transcription and defects in cell-cycle progression, DNA damage repair, and telomere silencing. In mammalian cells, H4K91glu is mainly enriched at promoter regions of highly expressed genes. A downregulation of H4K91glu is tightly associated with chromatin condensation during mitosis and in response to DNA damage.

Here, using single-cell analysis, we unexpectedly found that cyclin E/A-CDK activity can only maintain Rb hyperphosphorylation starting at the onset of S phase and that CDK4/6 activity, but not cyclin E/A-CDK activity, is required to hyperphosphorylate Rb throughout G1 phase. Mitogen removal in G1 results in a gradual loss of CDK4/6 activity with a high likelihood of cells sustaining Rb hyperphosphorylation until S phase, at which point cyclin E/A-CDK activity takes over.

By physically evoking conformational switching of AMPK, HSF1 impairs AMP binding to the γ subunits and enhances the PP2A-mediated de-phosphorylation, but it impedes the LKB1-mediated phosphorylation of Thr172, and retards ATP binding to the catalytic α subunits. These immediate and manifold regulations empower HSF1 to both repress AMPK under basal conditions and restrain its activation by diverse stimuli, thereby promoting lipogenesis, cholesterol synthesis, and protein cholesteroylation. In vivo, HSF1 antagonizes AMPK to control body fat mass and drive the lipogenic phenotype and growth of melanomas independently of its intrinsic transcriptional action. Thus, the physical AMPK-HSF1 interaction epitomizes a reciprocal kinase-substrate regulation whereby lipid metabolism and proteomic stability intertwine.",7,12.0,"{""Inhibition"": 6, ""Activation"": 1}"

SPIs further unveiled a role for Spt5 in promoting the 3' end processing of histone genes.

Upon stress, global translation halts and mRNAs bound to the translational machinery and other proteins coalesce to form stress granules (SGs). Similarly, translationally stalled mRNAs devoid of translation initiation factors shuttle to P-bodies (PBs). Here, we review the cumulative progress made in defining the protein components that associate with mammalian SGs and PBs. We discuss the composition of SG and PB proteomes, supported by a new user-friendly database (http://rnagranuledb.lunenfeld.ca/) that curates current literature evidence for genes or proteins associated with SGs or PBs. As previously observed, the SG and PB proteomes are biased toward intrinsically disordered regions and have a high propensity to contain primary sequence features favoring phase separation.

Here, we discover in adipocytes that the outer mitochondrial membrane protein MIGA2 links mitochondria to LDs. We identify an amphipathic LD-targeting motif and reveal that MIGA2 binds to the membrane proteins VAP-A or VAP-B in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We find that in adipocytes MIGA2 is involved in promoting triglyceride (TAG) synthesis from non-lipid precursors.

The implication of BH4-biosynthesis process in tumorigenesis remains to be investigated. Here, we show that PTPS, which is highly expressed in early-stage colorectal cancer, is phosphorylated at Thr 58 by AMPK under hypoxia; this phosphorylation promotes PTPS binding to LTBP1 and subsequently drives iNOS-mediated LTBP1 S-nitrosylation through proximal-coupling BH4 production within the PTPS/iNOS/LTBP1 complex. In turn, LTBP1 S-nitrosylation results in proteasome-dependent LTBP1 protein degradation, revealing an inverse relationship between PTPS pT58 and LTBP1 stability. Physiologically, the repressive effect of PTPS on LTBP1 leads to impaired transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) secretion and thereby maintains tumor cell growth under hypoxia. Our findings illustrate a molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of LTBP1-TGF-β signaling by the BH4-biosynthesis pathway and highlight the specific requirement of PTPS for tumor growth.",4,11.5,"{""Activation"": 1, ""Phosphorylation"": 1, ""Complex"": 2}"

We demonstrated that lysine demethylase 3A (KDM3A) binds to PGC-1α and demethylates monomethylated lysine (K) 224 of PGC-1α under normoxic conditions. Hypoxic stimulation inhibits KDM3A, which has a high KM of oxygen for its activity, and enhances PGC-1α K224 monomethylation. This modification decreases PGC-1α's activity required for NRF1- and NRF2-dependent transcriptional regulation of TFAM, TFB1M, and TFB2M, resulting in reduced mitochondrial biogenesis.

Presequence processing upon import is essential for proteostasis and survival, but the consequences of dysfunctional protein maturation are unknown. We find that impaired presequence processing causes accumulation of precursors inside mitochondria that form aggregates, which escape degradation and unexpectedly do not cause cell death. Instead, cells survive via activation of a mitochondrial unfolded protein response (mtUPR)-like pathway that is triggered very early after precursor accumulation. In contrast to classical stress pathways, this immediate response maintains mitochondrial protein import, membrane potential, and translation through translocation of the nuclear HMG-box transcription factor Rox1 to mitochondria.

Here we demonstrate that wild-type FUS binds single-stranded RNA stoichiometrically in a length-dependent manner and that multimers induce highly dynamic interactions with RNA, giving rise to small and fluid condensates. In contrast, mutations in arginine display a severely altered conformation, static binding to RNA, and formation of large condensates, signifying the role of arginine in driving proper RNA interaction. Glycine mutations undergo rapid loss of fluidity, emphasizing the role of glycine in promoting fluidity.

While RIF1/shieldin blocks 5'-3' nucleolytic processing of DNA ends, it remains unclear how PTIP antagonizes HR.

However, double-mutant cells fail to complete HR, as excessive shieldin activity also inhibits RNF168-mediated loading of PALB2/RAD51. As a result, BRCA1Δ1153BP1S25A mice exhibit hallmark features of HR insufficiency, including premature aging and hypersensitivity to PARPi. Disruption of shieldin or forced targeting of PALB2 to ssDNA in BRCA1D1153BP1S25A cells restores RNF168 recruitment, RAD51 nucleofilament formation, and PARPi resistance.

During this metabolic state, pro-growth gene expression is dampened; however, mutation of the Taf14 YEATS domain, a H3K9 crotonylation reader, results in de-repression of these genes. Conversely, exogenous addition of crotonic acid results in increased histone crotonylation, constitutive repression of pro-growth genes, and disrupted YMC oscillations.

We uncover an exponential relation between Cascade copy number and CRISPR interference levels, pointing to a time-driven arms race between invader replication and target search, in which 20 Cascade complexes provide 50% protection. Driven by PAM-interacting subunit Cas8e, Cascade spends half its search time rapidly probing DNA (∼30 ms) in the nucleoid. We further demonstrate that target DNA transcription and CRISPR arrays affect the integrity of Cascade and affect CRISPR interference.

We show here that PGAM5 inhibition attenuates lipid metabolism and colorectal tumorigenesis in mice. PGAM5-mediated dephosphorylation of malic enzyme 1 (ME1) at S336 allows increased ACAT1-mediated K337 acetylation, leading to ME1 dimerization and activation, both of which are reversed by NEK1 kinase-mediated S336 phosphorylation. SIRT6 deacetylase antagonizes ACAT1 function in a manner that involves mutually exclusive ME1 S336 phosphorylation and K337 acetylation. ME1 also promotes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) production, lipogenesis, and colorectal cancers in which ME1 transcripts are upregulated and ME1 protein is hypophosphorylated at S336 and hyperacetylated at K337. PGAM5 and ME1 upregulation occur via direct transcriptional activation mediated by β-catenin/TCF1.

In contrast to many amyloid prions, condensation of Vts1 enhances its function in mRNA decay, and its self-assembly properties are conserved over large evolutionary distances. Yeast cells harboring [SMAUG+] downregulate a coherent network of mRNAs and exhibit improved growth under nutrient limitation. Vts1 condensates formed from purified protein can transform naive cells to acquire [SMAUG+].

Here, we demonstrate that RAD51-dependent replication fork reversal induced by R-loops is followed by the restart of semiconservative DNA replication mediated by RECQ1 and RECQ5 helicases, MUS81/EME1 endonuclease, RAD52 strand-annealing factor, the DNA ligase IV (LIG4)/XRCC4 complex, and the non-catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase δ, POLD3. RECQ5 disrupts RAD51 filaments assembled on stalled forks after RECQ1-mediated reverse branch migration, preventing a new round of fork reversal and facilitating fork cleavage by MUS81/EME1. MUS81-dependent DNA breaks accumulate in cells lacking RAD52 or LIG4 upon induction of R-loop formation, suggesting that RAD52 acts in concert with LIG4/XRCC4 to catalyze fork religation, thereby mediating replication restart. The resumption of DNA synthesis after R-loop-associated fork stalling also requires active transcription, the restoration of which depends on MUS81, RAD52, LIG4, and the transcription elongation factor ELL.

Upon serum deprivation, a subset of AEs pre-marked by the activity-dependent neuroprotector homeobox Protein (ADNP) and located near cell-cycle genes recruits TFIIIC, which alters their chromatin accessibility by direct acetylation of histone H3 lysine-18 (H3K18).

This is independent of Linx transcription and independent of any effect on Tsix, the antisense regulator of Xist that shares the same TAD as Linx. Unlike Tsix, LinxP is well conserved across mammals, suggesting an ancestral mechanism for random monoallelic Xist regulation.

We demonstrate here that MeCP2 represses nascent RNA transcription of highly methylated long genes in the brain through its interaction with the NCoR co-repressor complex. By measuring the rates of transcriptional initiation and elongation directly in the brain, we find that MeCP2 has no measurable effect on transcriptional elongation, but instead represses the rate at which Pol II initiates transcription of highly methylated long genes. These findings suggest a new model of MeCP2 function in which MeCP2 binds broadly across highly methylated regions of DNA, but acts at transcription start sites to attenuate transcriptional initiation.",1,1.5,"{""Inhibition"": 1}"

MeCP2 represses enhancers found in these domains that are enriched for non-CG and CG methylation, with the strongest repression occurring for enhancers located within MeCP2-repressed genes.

We show that termination is completely abolished by rapid elimination of CPSF73, which causes very extensive transcriptional readthrough genome-wide. This is because CPSF73 functions upstream of modifications to the elongation complex and provides an entry site for the XRN2 torpedo. Rapid depletion of XRN2 enriches these events that we show are underpinned by protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) activity, the inhibition of which extends readthrough in the absence of XRN2.

In addition to constitutive loci such as pericentromeres and subtelomeres, heterochromatin can be found interspersed in gene-rich euchromatin, where it regulates gene expression pertinent to cell fate. While heterochromatin and euchromatin are globally poised for mutual antagonism, the mechanisms underlying precise spatial encoding of heterochromatin containment within euchromatic sites remain opaque. We investigated ectopic heterochromatin invasion by manipulating the fission yeast mating type locus boundary using a single-cell spreading reporter system. We found that heterochromatin repulsion is locally encoded by Set1/COMPASS on certain actively transcribed genes and that this protective role is most prominent at heterochromatin islands, small domains interspersed in euchromatin that regulate cell fate specifiers. Sensitivity to invasion by heterochromatin, surprisingly, is not dependent on Set1 altering overall gene expression levels. Rather, the gene-protective effect is strictly dependent on Set1's catalytic activity. H3K4 methylation, the Set1 product, antagonizes spreading in two ways: directly inhibiting catalysis by Suv39/Clr4 and locally disrupting nucleosome stability.

In the current study, we show that Wnt5A, a non-canonical Wnt ligand that drives a metastatic, therapy-resistant phenotype, stabilizes the half-life of p53 and uses p53 to initiate a slow-cycling state following stress (DNA damage, targeted therapy, and aging). Inhibiting p53 blocks the slow-cycling phenotype and sensitizes melanoma cells to BRAF/MEK inhibition. In vivo, this can be accomplished with a single dose of p53 inhibitor at the commencement of BRAF/MEK inhibitor therapy. These data suggest that taking the paradoxical approach of inhibiting rather than activating wild-type p53 may sensitize previously resistant metastatic melanoma cells to therapy.",0,0.0,{}

This reduction in eIF2 activity results in dysregulation of global and gene-specific protein synthesis and enhances cell death upon stress induction.

However, the dynamics of three-dimensional chromatin structure in this process is poorly characterized. Using low-input Hi-C (genome-wide chromatin conformation capture), we found that a unique chromatin organization gradually appears during mouse oocyte growth. Oocytes at late stages show self-interacting, cohesin-independent compartmental domains marked by H3K27me3, therefore termed Polycomb-associating domains (PADs). PADs and inter-PAD (iPAD) regions form compartment-like structures with strong inter-domain interactions among nearby PADs. PADs disassemble upon meiotic resumption from diplotene arrest but briefly reappear on the maternal genome after fertilization. Upon maternal depletion of Eed, PADs are largely intact in oocytes, but their reestablishment after fertilization is compromised. By contrast, depletion of Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) proteins attenuates PADs in oocytes, which is associated with substantial gene de-repression in PADs.

The accumulation of these transcripts is accompanied by changes at genic nucleosomes and Pol II redistribution. H2Bub is required for FACT activity in genic regions. In the H2Bub mutant, FACT binding to chromatin is altered and its association with histones is stabilized, which leads to the reduction of genic nucleosomes. Interestingly, FACT depletion globally restores nucleosomes in the H2Bub mutant. Moreover, in the absence of Pob3, the FACT Spt16 subunit controls the 3' end of genes.

We developed nanopore analysis of co-transcriptional processing (nano-COP), in which nascent RNAs are directly sequenced through nanopores, exposing the dynamics and patterns of RNA splicing without biases introduced by amplification. Long nano-COP reads reveal that, in human and Drosophila cells, splicing occurs after RNA polymerase II transcribes several kilobases of pre-mRNA, suggesting that metazoan splicing transpires distally from the transcription machinery. Inhibition of the branch-site recognition complex SF3B rapidly diminished global co-transcriptional splicing. We found that splicing order does not strictly follow the order of transcription and is associated with cis-acting elements, alternative splicing, and RNA-binding factors. Further, neighboring introns in human cells tend to be spliced concurrently, implying that splicing of these introns occurs cooperatively.

As a consequence, inactivation of CDK7 reduced organ size and inhibited tumor growth, which could be reversed by restoring Yki/Yap activity.

In vertebrates, double-strand breaks are repaired predominantly by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), which directly ligates DNA ends. NHEJ has the potential to be highly mutagenic because it uses DNA polymerases, nucleases, and other enzymes that modify incompatible DNA ends to allow their ligation. Using frog egg extracts that recapitulate NHEJ, we show that end processing requires the formation of a ""short-range synaptic complex"" in which DNA ends are closely aligned in a ligation-competent state. Furthermore, single-molecule imaging directly demonstrates that processing occurs within the short-range complex. This confinement of end processing to a ligation-competent complex ensures that DNA ends undergo ligation as soon as they become compatible, thereby minimizing mutagenesis.

Similarly, TRPS1 expression is indispensable for proliferation of mammary organoids and in vivo survival of luminal epithelial cells during mammary gland development. However, the consequences of TRPS1 loss are dependent on E-cadherin status, as combined inactivation of E-cadherin and TRPS1 causes persistent proliferation of mammary organoids and accelerated mammary tumor formation in mice.

Our data suggest the presence of a molecular rheostat consisting of two translational activators, Cbp3-Cbp6 and Cbs1, which operates at the mitoribosomal tunnel exit to connect translational output with assembly efficiency. When Cbp3-Cbp6 is engaged in assembly of cytochrome b, Cbs1 binds to the tunnel exit to sequester the cytochrome b-encoding mRNA, repressing its translation.

Our review of the literature suggests an alternative view. We propose that 53BP1 has evolved to avoid mutagenic repair outcomes and does so by controlling the processing of DNA ends and the dynamics of DSBs. The consequences of 53BP1 deficiency, such as diminished PARPi efficacy in BRCA1-deficient cells and altered repair of damaged telomeres, can be explained from this viewpoint. We further propose that some of the fidelity functions of 53BP1 coevolved with class switch recombination (CSR) in the immune system.

In addition to repressing repeats, H3K9me3 influences expression of both hetero- and euchromatic host genes.

Effects on translational efficiency are minimal compared to effects on mRNA levels, even for newly transcribed target mRNAs. Effects on target mRNA levels accumulate as the mRNA population approaches steady state, whereas effects on tail lengths peak for recently transcribed target mRNAs and then subside. Computational modeling of this phenomenon reveals that miRNAs cause not only accelerated deadenylation of their targets but also accelerated decay of short-tailed target molecules.

Moreover, inhibition of aberrant TrkB or MEK activation rescues the increased neurogenesis caused by knockdown or homozygous loss of Ptprd. These results suggest that PTPRD regulates receptor tyrosine kinases to ensure appropriate numbers of intermediate progenitor cells and neurons, suggesting a mechanism for its genetic association with neurodevelopmental disorders.",9,13.5,"{""Inhibition"": 7, ""Activation"": 2}"

We screened an Arabidopsis transfer DNA (T-DNA) insertion library and identified a cold-hypersensitive mutant, which we named stch4 (sensitive to chilling 4). STCH4/REIL2 encodes a ribosomal biogenesis factor that is upregulated upon cold stress. Overexpression of STCH4 confers chilling and freezing tolerance in Arabidopsis. The stch4 mutation reduces CBF protein levels and thus delayed the induction of C-repeat-binding factor (CBF) regulon genes. Ribosomal RNA processing is reduced in stch4 mutants, especially under cold stress. STCH4 associates with multiple ribosomal proteins, and these interactions are modulated by cold stress. These results suggest that the ribosome is a regulatory node for cold stress responses and that STCH4 promotes an altered ribosomal composition and functions in low temperatures to facilitate the translation of proteins important for plant growth and survival under cold stress.",1,0.0,"{""Activation"": 1}"

In this study, we find that under the ""ground state"" of pluripotency with two inhibitors (2i) of the MEK and GSK3 pathways, Setdb1-knockout fails to induce trophectoderm (TE) differentiation as in serum/LIF (SL), indicating that TE fate restriction is not the direct target of SETDB1. In both conditions, Setdb1-knockout activates a group of genes targeted by SETDB1-mediated H3K9 methylation, including Dux.

Furthermore, Setdb1-null ESCs maintain pluripotent marker (e.g., Nanog) expression in the 2i condition.

How SWR accesses the opposite side of +1 to generate a ZZ nucleosome remains unclear. Using biochemical assays that monitor the sub-nucleosomal position of nascent H2A.Z, we find that NFR-recruited SWR switches sides to insert H2A.Z into asymmetrically positioned nucleosomes; however, at decreasing temperatures, H2A.Z insertion becomes progressively biased for one side. We find that a 16-bp element containing G/C runs (>3 consecutive G or C nucleotides) is sufficient to promote H2A.Z insertion.

Prompted by this, we find that transforming acid coiled-coil protein 3 (TACC3), widely studied in mitotic spindle formation, regulates the cytoplasmic localization of the microtubule polymerizing factor chTOG and influences microtubule plus-end dynamics during interphase to control infection in distinct cell types. Furthermore, perturbing TACC3 function in neuronal cells resulted in the formation of disorganized stable, detyrosinated microtubule networks and changes in cellular morphology, as well as impaired trafficking of both HSV-1 and transferrin. These trafficking defects in TACC3-depleted cells were reversed by the depletion of kinesin-1 heavy chains.

HSCs contain less misfolded and unfolded proteins than myeloid progenitors. Increases in protein synthesis cause HSCs to accumulate misfolded and unfolded proteins. To test how proteome quality affects HSCs, we examine Aarssti/sti mice that harbor a tRNA editing defect that increases amino acid misincorporation. Aarssti/sti mice exhibit reduced HSC numbers, increased proliferation, and diminished serial reconstituting activity. Misfolded proteins overwhelm the proteasome within Aarssti/sti HSCs, which is associated with increased c-Myc abundance.

DDX18 binds and sequesters PRC2 in the outer layer of the nucleolus and counteracts PRC2 complex formation in vivo and in vitro. DDX18 knockdown leads to increased occupancy of PRC2 and H3K27me3 at rDNA loci, accompanied by drastically decreased rRNA transcription and reduced ribosomal protein expression and translation. Auxin-induced rapid degradation of DDX18 enhances PRC2 binding at rDNA. The inhibition of PRC2 partially rescues the effects of DDX18 depletion on rRNA transcription and ESC self-renewal.

Cell-autonomous induction of invasion components using constitutively active Src induces DRG axon regeneration, suggesting an intrinsic mechanism can be activated to drive regeneration.

Females with oocyte-specific depletion of Snf2h are infertile and oocytes lacking Snf2h fail to undergo meiotic resumption. Mechanistically, depletion of Snf2h results in dysregulation of meiosis-related genes, which causes failure of maturation-promoting factor (MPF) activation. ATAC-seq analysis in oocytes revealed that Snf2h regulates transcription of key meiotic genes, such as Prkar2b, by increasing its promoter chromatin accessibility.

31919190,"Centromeres are maintained epigenetically by the presence of CENP-A, an evolutionarily conserved histone H3 variant, which directs kinetochore assembly and hence centromere function. To identify factors that promote assembly of CENP-A chromatin, we affinity-selected solubilized fission yeast CENP-ACnp1 chromatin. All subunits of the Ino80 complex were enriched, including the auxiliary subunit Hap2. Chromatin association of Hap2 is Ies4-dependent. In addition to a role in maintenance of CENP-ACnp1 chromatin integrity at endogenous centromeres, Hap2 is required for de novo assembly of CENP-ACnp1 chromatin on naïve centromere DNA and promotes H3 turnover on centromere regions and other loci prone to CENP-ACnp1 deposition. Prior to CENP-ACnp1 chromatin assembly, Hap2 facilitates transcription from centromere DNA. These analyses suggest that Hap2-Ino80 destabilizes H3 nucleosomes on centromere DNA through transcription-coupled histone H3 turnover, driving the replacement of resident H3 nucleosomes with CENP-ACnp1 nucleosomes. These inherent properties define centromere DNA by directing a program that mediates CENP-ACnp1 assembly on appropriate sequences.",2,1.5,"{""Activation"": 2}"
31919191,"Promoting axon regeneration in the central and peripheral nervous system is of clinical importance in neural injury and neurodegenerative diseases.

Ringer is expressed in sensory neurons before and after injury, and is cell-autonomously required for axon regeneration. While loss of ringer abolishes the regeneration enhancement in Rtca mutants, its overexpression is sufficient to promote regeneration both in the peripheral and central nervous system. Ringer maintains microtubule stability/dynamics with the microtubule-associated protein futsch/MAP1B, which is also required for axon regeneration. Furthermore, ringer lies downstream from and is negatively regulated by the microtubule-associated deacetylase HDAC6, which functions as a regeneration inhibitor.

We previously described the regulatory events that control the timely synthesis of Ndc80. Here, we report that Ndc80 turnover is also tightly regulated in meiosis: Ndc80 degradation is active in meiotic prophase, but not in metaphase I. Ndc80 degradation depends on the ubiquitin ligase APCAma1 and is mediated by the proteasome. Importantly, Aurora B-dependent Ndc80 phosphorylation, a mark that has been previously implicated in correcting erroneous microtubule-kinetochore attachments, is essential for Ndc80 degradation in a microtubule-independent manner. The N terminus of Ndc80, including a 27-residue sequence and Aurora B phosphorylation sites, is both necessary and sufficient for kinetochore protein degradation. Finally, defects in Ndc80 turnover predispose meiotic cells to chromosome mis-segregation.

GNE-0723 use dependently potentiates synaptic NMDA receptor currents and reduces brain oscillation power with a predominant effect on low-frequency (12-20 Hz) oscillations. Interestingly, DS and AD mouse models display aberrant low-frequency oscillatory power that is tightly correlated with network hypersynchrony. GNE-0723 treatment reduces aberrant low-frequency oscillations and epileptiform discharges and improves cognitive functions in DS and AD mouse models.

Using calcium imaging in vivo, we demonstrate that FLP encodes thermal information in a tonic and graded manner over a wide thermal range spanning from noxious cold to noxious heat (8°C-36°C). This tonic-signaling mode allows FLP to trigger sustained behavioral changes necessary for escape behavior. Furthermore, we identify specific transient receptor potential, voltage-gated calcium, and sodium ""leak"" channels controlling sensory gain, thermal sensitivity, and signal kinetics, respectively, and show that the ryanodine receptor is required for long-lasting activation.

Failure to clear release sites from previously exocytosed material has been shown to impair vesicle replenishment and, therefore, fast neurotransmission. The identity of this material and the machinery that removes it from release sites have remained enigmatic. Here we show that the endocytic scaffold protein intersectin 1 clears release sites by direct SH3 domain-mediated association with a non-canonical proline-rich segment of synaptobrevin assembled into the SNARE complex for neuroexocytosis. Acute structure-based or sustained genetic interference with SNARE complex recognition by intersectin 1 causes a rapid stimulation frequency-dependent depression of neurotransmission due to impaired replenishment of release-ready SVs.

31940486,"For decades, two fusion modes were thought to control hormone and transmitter release essential to life; one facilitates release via fusion pore dilation and flattening (full collapse), and the other limits release by closing a narrow fusion pore (kiss-and-run). Using super-resolution stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy to visualize fusion modes of dense-core vesicles in neuroendocrine cells, we find that facilitation of release is mediated not by full collapse but by shrink fusion, in which the Ω-profile generated by vesicle fusion shrinks but maintains a large non-dilating pore. We discover that the physiological osmotic pressure of a cell squeezes, but does not dilate, the Ω-profile, which explains why shrink fusion prevails over full collapse. Instead of kiss-and-run, enlarge fusion, in which Ω-profiles grow while maintaining a narrow pore, slows down release. Shrink and enlarge fusion may thus account for diverse hormone and transmitter release kinetics observed in secretory cells, previously interpreted within the full-collapse/kiss-and-run framework.",0,0.0,{}

Here, we record from the dorsal hippocampus and RSC simultaneously in freely behaving mice during sleep and reveal that the RSC displays a pre-ripple activation associated with slow and fast oscillations. Immediately after ripples, a subpopulation of RSC putative inhibitory neurons increases firing activity, while most RSC putative excitatory neurons decrease activity. Consistently, optogenetic stimulation of this hippocampus-RSC pathway activates and suppresses RSC putative inhibitory and excitatory neurons, respectively.

Here, we characterize receptive fields (RFs) of motion-sensitive neurons in the diencephalon and midbrain. We show that RFs of many pretectal neurons are large and sample the lower visual field, whereas RFs of tectal neurons are mostly small-size selective and sample the upper nasal visual field more densely. Furthermore, optomotor swimming can reliably be evoked by presenting forward motion in the lower temporal visual field alone, matching the lower visual field bias of the pretectum.

To better define this region, we genome-edited the syntenic 1p36 locus in primary mouse neural crest cells (NCCs), a putative NBL cell of origin. In in vitro cell transformation assays, we show that Chd5 loss confers most of the MYCN-independent tumor suppressor effects of 1p36 LOH.

Mechanistically, DNA damage activates ATM to phosphorylate p53 on Ser33 and Ser37, which facilitates the FBXW7 binding and subsequent p53 degradation by SCFFBXW7. Inactivation of ATM or SCFFBXW7 by small molecular inhibitors or genetic knockdown/knockout approaches extends the p53 protein half-life upon DNA damage in an MDM2-independent manner.

Further, LIGHT-VTP efficiently targets pathological blood vessels in the pre-metastatic niche, reducing vascular hyper-permeability and extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition, thus blocking metastatic lung colonization. Moreover, we demonstrate that mouse and human metastatic melanoma deposits are targetable by VTP. In overt melanoma metastases, LIGHT-VTP normalizes intra-metastatic blood vessels and increases GrzB+ effector T cells. Successful treatment induces high endothelial venules (HEVs) and lymphocyte clusters, which sensitize refractory lung metastases to anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors. These findings demonstrate an important application for LIGHT-VTP therapy in preventing metastatic development as well as exerting anti-tumor effects in established metastases.",0,0.0,{}

Herein, we report that MAVS is a key regulator of p53 activation and is critical for protecting against tumorigenesis. We find that MAVS promotes p53-dependent cell death in response to DNA damage. MAVS interacts with p53 and mediates p53 mitochondrial recruitment under genotoxic stress. Mechanistically, MAVS inhibits p53 ubiquitination by blocking the formation of the p53-murine double-minute 2 (MDM2) complex, leading to the stabilization of p53. Notably, compared with their wild-type littermates, MAVS knockout mice display decreased resistance to azoxymethane (AOM) or AOM/dextran sulfate sodium salt (DSS)-induced colon cancer. MAVS expression is significantly downregulated in human colon cancer tissues.

Here, we present an unexpected role of VDR in normal hematopoiesis and in leukemogenesis. Limited VDR expression is associated with impaired myeloid progenitor differentiation and is a new prognostic factor in AML. In mice, the lack of Vdr results in increased numbers of hematopoietic and leukemia stem cells and quiescent hematopoietic stem cells. In addition, malignant transformation of Vdr-/- cells results in myeloid differentiation block and increases self-renewal. Vdr promoter is methylated in AML as in CD34+ cells, and demethylating agents induce VDR expression. Association of VDR agonists with hypomethylating agents promotes leukemia stem cell exhaustion and decreases tumor burden in AML mouse models. Thus, Vdr functions as a regulator of stem cell homeostasis and leukemic propagation.",2,3.0,"{""Inhibition"": 1, ""Activation"": 1}"

We demonstrate that specific pharmacological or genetic inhibition of EZH2 catalytic activity impairs distant metastasis. We further define a specific EZH2high population with enhanced invasion, mammosphere formation, and metastatic potential that exhibits marked sensitivity to EZH2 inhibition. Mechanistically, EZH2 inhibition differentiates EZH2high basal cells to a luminal-like phenotype by derepressing GATA3 and renders them sensitive to endocrine therapy. Furthermore, dissection of human TNBC heterogeneity shows that EZH2high basal-like 1 and mesenchymal subtypes have exquisite sensitivity to EZH2 inhibition compared with the EZH2low luminal androgen receptor subtype.

Overexpression of PRKCI, SOX2, and ECT2 in the context of Trp53 loss is sufficient to transform mouse lung basal stem cells into tumors with histological and genomic features of LSCC. Functionally, PRKCI and SOX2 collaborate to activate an extensive transcriptional program that enforces a lineage-restricted LSCC phenotype, whereas PRKCI and ECT2 collaborate to promote oncogenic growth. Gene signatures indicative of PKCι-SOX2 and PKCι-ECT2 signaling activity are enriched in the classical subtype of human LSCC and predict distinct therapeutic vulnerabilities.

We demonstrate here that durable tolerance toward mis-matched lung progenitors and their derivatives can be achieved without any chronic immune suppression, by virtue of co-transplantation with hematopoietic progenitors from the same donor.

Here, we examine chromosome conformation in embryonic stem cells lacking cohesin and find, as in other cell types, that cohesin is required to create TADs and regulate A/B compartmentalization. However, in the absence of cohesin, we identify a series of long-range chromosomal interactions that persist. These correspond to regions of the genome occupied by the polycomb repressive system and are dependent on PRC1. Importantly, we discover that cohesin counteracts these polycomb-dependent interactions, but not interactions between super-enhancers. This disruptive activity is independent of CTCF and insulation and appears to modulate gene repression by the polycomb system.

Formation of nephrospheres reestablishes renal identity and function in primary cultures. Transplantation into NOD/SCID mice shows that nephrospheres restore self-organogenetic properties lost in monolayer cultures, allowing long-term engraftment as tubular structures, potentially adding nephron segments and demonstrating self-organization as critical to survival. Furthermore, long-term tubular engraftment of nephrospheres is functionally beneficial in murine models of chronic kidney disease.

Disruption of autophagy in CySCs and early cyst cells (CCs) by the depletion of autophagy-related (Atg) genes reduced early CC numbers and affected CC function, resembling decreased epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling. Indeed, our data indicate that EGFR acts to stimulate autophagy to preserve early CC function, whereas target of rapamycin (TOR) negatively regulates autophagy in the differentiating CCs. Finally, we show that the EGFR-mediated stimulation of autophagy regulates lipid levels in CySCs and CCs.

Heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein D-like (hnRNPDL) is a RNA-processing prion-like protein with three alternative splicing (AS) isoforms, which lack none, one, or both of its two disordered domains. It has been suggested that AS might regulate the assembly properties of RNA-processing proteins by controlling the incorporation of multivalent disordered regions in the isoforms. This, in turn, would modulate their activity in the downstream splicing program. Here, we demonstrate that AS controls the phase separation of hnRNPDL, as well as the size and dynamics of its nuclear complexes, its nucleus-cytoplasm shuttling, and amyloidogenicity. Mutation of the highly conserved D378 in the disordered C-terminal prion-like domain of hnRNPDL causes limb-girdle muscular dystrophy 1G.

Upon pore formation and the subsequent influx of intracellular calcium, TMEM16F induced rapid ""lipid scrambling"" in the plasma membrane. This response was accompanied by membrane blebbing, extracellular vesicle release, preserved membrane integrity, and increased cell viability. TMEM16F-deficient mice exhibited compromised control of infection by Listeria monocytogenes associated with a greater sensitivity of neutrophils to the pore-forming Listeria toxin listeriolysin O (LLO).

Although BM-Ad shows enrichment in proteins involved in cholesterol metabolism, correlating with increased free cholesterol content, proteins involved in lipolysis were downregulated. In particular, monoacylglycerol lipase expression is strongly reduced in BM-Ads, leading to monoacylglycerol accumulation. Consequently, basal and induced lipolytic responses are absent in BM-Ads, affirming their differences in metabolic fitness upon caloric restriction.

Mice lacking the Eif4g1 microexon display social behavior, learning, and memory deficits, accompanied by altered hippocampal synaptic plasticity. We provide evidence that the eIF4G microexons function as a translational brake by causing ribosome stalling, through their propensity to promote the coalescence of cytoplasmic granule components associated with translation repression, including the fragile X mental retardation protein FMRP.

Moreover, FCRL3 stimulation induced IL-17, IL-26, and IFNγ production and promoted expression of the Th17-defining transcription factor RORγt without affecting FOXP3 expression. We suggest that FCRL3 engagement mediates a transition of regulatory T cells to a pro-inflammatory Th17-like phenotype. In addition, we identified secretory IgA as a specific FCRL3 ligand. Secretory IgA could serve as an environmental cue for mucosal breaches and locally drive regulatory T cell plasticity to help control infection.

We demonstrate that in human HSCs, TET3 promotes profibrotic gene expression by upregulation of multiple key TGF-β pathway genes, including TGFB1. TET3 binds to target gene promoters, inducing demethylation, which in turn facilitates chromatin remodeling and transcription. We also reveal a positive feedback loop between TGF-β1 and TET3 in both HSCs and hepatocytes. Furthermore, TET3 knockdown ameliorates liver fibrosis in mice.

Stable gene expression patterns are the result of combinatorial activity of multiple transcription factors, which mark regulatory regions long before activation and promote progressive broadening of active chromatin domains.

We find holoenzyme assembly and disassembly in vivo are highly dynamic and ordered. PCNA generally loads onto the genome before Pol δ. Once assembled, the holoenzyme has a relatively short lifetime on the genome, implying multiple Pol δ binding events may be needed to synthesize an Okazaki fragment. During disassembly, Pol δ dissociation generally precedes PCNA unloading. We also find that Pol δ p125, the catalytic subunit of the holoenzyme, is maintained at a constant cellular level, indicating an active mechanism for control of Pol δ levels in vivo.

We find that the BLM helicase promotes RMDs with long DSB/repeat distances (e.g., 28.4 kbp), which is consistent with a role in extensive DSB end resection, because the resection nucleases EXO1 and DNA2 affect RMDs similarly to BLM. In contrast, BLM suppresses RMDs with sequence divergence and intermediate (e.g., 3.3 kbp) DSB/repeat distances, which supports a role in heteroduplex rejection. The role of BLM in heteroduplex rejection is not epistatic with MSH2 and is independent of the annealing factor RAD52.

How the TMG cap affects hTR maturation is unknown. Here, we show that depletion of trimethylguanosine synthase 1 (TGS1), the enzyme responsible for cap hypermethylation, increases levels of hTR and telomerase. Diminished trimethylation increases hTR association with the cap-binding complex (CBC) and with Sm chaperone proteins. Loss of TGS1 causes an increase in accumulation of mature hTR in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm compared with controls. In TGS1 mutant cells, increased hTR assembles with telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) protein to yield elevated active telomerase complexes and increased telomerase activity, resulting in telomere elongation in cultured human cells.

Furthermore, we investigate how cells recognize and deal with DNA ADP-ribosylation. We demonstrate that DNA ADPr stalls replication and is perceived as DNA damage. Removal of ADPr from DNA requires the sequential activity of two DNA repair pathways, with RecF-mediated homologous recombination likely to transfer ADP-ribosylation from single- to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and subsequent nucleotide excision repair eliminating the lesion.

This was not by increased proliferation or suppression of early plasmablast differentiation, but rather by preferential recruitment and progression through these early stages of B cell activation, culminating in preferential transition into GC. Once established, this bias was stable in GC over several weeks; other BCL6-regulated GC B cell behaviors were unaffected.

32029452,"ADP-ribosylation (ADPRylation) is a posttranslational modification of proteins discovered nearly six decades ago, but many important questions remain regarding its molecular functions and biological roles, as well as the activity of the ADP-ribose (ADPR) transferase enzymes (PARP family members) that catalyze it. Growing evidence indicates that PARP-mediated ADPRylation events are key regulators of the protein biosynthetic pathway, leading from rDNA transcription and ribosome biogenesis to mRNA synthesis, processing, and translation. In this review we describe the role of PARP proteins and ADPRylation in all facets of this pathway. PARP-1 and its enzymatic activity are key regulators of rDNA transcription, which is a critical step in ribosome biogenesis. An emerging role of PARPs in alternative splicing of mRNAs, as well as direct ADPRylation of mRNAs, highlight the role of PARP members in RNA processing. Furthermore, PARP activity, stimulated by cellular stresses, such as viral infections and ER stress, leads to the regulation of mRNA stability and protein synthesis through posttranscriptional mechanisms. Dysregulation of PARP activity in these processes can promote disease states. Collectively, these results highlight the importance of PARP family members and ADPRylation in gene regulation, mRNA processing, and protein abundance. Future studies in these areas will yield new insights into the fundamental mechanisms and a broader utility for PARP-targeted therapeutic agents.",2,3.0,"{""Activation"": 2}"

32029455,"Oxidative and replication stress underlie genomic instability of cancer cells. Amplifying genomic instability through radiotherapy and chemotherapy has been a powerful but nonselective means of killing cancer cells. Precision medicine has revolutionized cancer therapy by putting forth the concept of selective targeting of cancer cells. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors represent a successful example of precision medicine as the first drugs targeting DNA damage response to have entered the clinic. PARP inhibitors act through synthetic lethality with mutations in DNA repair genes and were approved for the treatment of BRCA mutated ovarian and breast cancer. PARP inhibitors destabilize replication forks through PARP DNA entrapment and induce cell death through replication stress-induced mitotic catastrophe. Inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG) exploit and exacerbate replication deficiencies of cancer cells and may complement PARP inhibitors in targeting a broad range of cancer types with different sources of genomic instability.

32029457,"Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is an essential cofactor for redox enzymes, but also moonlights as a substrate for signaling enzymes. When used as a substrate by signaling enzymes, it is consumed, necessitating the recycling of NAD+ consumption products (i.e., nicotinamide) via a salvage pathway in order to maintain NAD+ homeostasis. A major family of NAD+ consumers in mammalian cells are poly-ADP-ribose-polymerases (PARPs). PARPs comprise a family of 17 enzymes in humans, 16 of which catalyze the transfer of ADP-ribose from NAD+ to macromolecular targets (namely, proteins, but also DNA and RNA). Because PARPs and the NAD+ biosynthetic enzymes are subcellularly localized, an emerging concept is that the activity of PARPs and other NAD+ consumers are regulated in a compartmentalized manner.

Using an induced neuron (iN) culture system, we show that maternally expressed miRNAs from the miR-379/410 cluster direct the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to transcriptional and developmental regulators, including paternally expressed transcripts like Plagl1. Maternal deletion of this imprinted miRNA cluster resulted in increased protein levels of several targets and upregulation of a broader transcriptional program regulating synaptic transmission and neuronal function.

32032532,"Cohesin, a member of the SMC complex family, holds sister chromatids together but also shapes chromosomes by promoting the formation of long-range intra-chromatid loops, a process proposed to be mediated by DNA loop extrusion. Here we describe the roles of three cohesin partners, Pds5, Wpl1, and Eco1, in loop formation along either unreplicated or mitotic Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosomes. Pds5 limits the size of DNA loops via two different pathways: the canonical Wpl1-mediated releasing activity and an Eco1-dependent mechanism. In the absence of Pds5, the main barrier to DNA loop expansion appears to be the centromere. Our data also show that Eco1 acetyl-transferase inhibits the translocase activity that powers loop formation and contributes to the positioning of loops through a mechanism that is distinguishable from its role in cohesion establishment.

Here, we demonstrate that chromatin-bound cohesin is necessary to retain elongating Pol II at centromeres. We find that WAPL-mediated removal of cohesin from chromosome arms during prophase is required for the dissociation of Pol II and nascent transcripts, and failure of this process dramatically alters mitotic gene expression. Removal of cohesin/Pol II from chromosome arms in prophase is important for accurate chromosome segregation and normal activation of gene expression in G1.

However, in many cases, the precise sequence features governing condensate formation and identity remain unclear. Here, we investigate the role of intrinsically disordered mixed-charge domains (MCDs) in nuclear speckle condensation. Proteins composed exclusively of arginine-aspartic acid dipeptide repeats undergo length-dependent condensation and speckle incorporation. Substituting arginine with lysine in synthetic and natural speckle-associated MCDs abolishes these activities, identifying a key role for multivalent contacts through arginine's guanidinium ion. MCDs can synergize with a speckle-associated RNA recognition motif to promote speckle specificity and residence. MCD behavior is tunable through net-charge: increasing negative charge abolishes condensation and speckle incorporation. Contrastingly, increasing positive charge through arginine leads to enhanced condensation, speckle enlargement, decreased splicing factor mobility, and defective mRNA export. Together, these results identify key sequence determinants of MCD-promoted speckle condensation and link the dynamic material properties of speckles with function in mRNA processing.",1,1.5,"{""Activation"": 1}"

By directly profiling decay factor targets and normal versus aberrant translation in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), we uncovered extensive decay pathway specialization and crosstalk with translation. XRN1 (5'-3') mediates cytoplasmic bulk mRNA turnover whereas SKIV2L (3'-5') is universally recruited by ribosomes, tackling aberrant translation and sometimes modulating mRNA abundance. Further exploring translation surveillance revealed AVEN and FOCAD as SKIV2L interactors. AVEN prevents ribosome stalls at structured regions, which otherwise require SKIV2L for clearance.

This effect can be recapitulated by partial, adult-restricted inhibition, with both enterocytes and stem cells of the adult midgut emerging as important cell types. In stem cells, Pol I appears to act in the same longevity pathway as Pol III, implicating rRNA synthesis in these cells as the key lifespan determinant.

Treatment with the NAD+ metabolic precursor nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) rejuvenates oocyte quality in aged animals, leading to restoration in fertility, and this can be recapitulated by transgenic overexpression of the NAD+-dependent deacylase SIRT2, though deletion of this enzyme does not impair oocyte quality.

In Tramtrack-depleted ISCs, the ectopically expressed Deadpan acts as a major self-renewal factor for cell propagation, and Sequoia acts as a differentiation factor for the neuroendocrine phenotype. In addition, the expression of Sequoia renders NSC-specific self-renewal genes responsive to Notch in ISCs, thus inverting the differentiation-promoting function of Notch into a self-renewal role as in normal NSCs.

The paracrine pathway for MSC-mediated IL-10+ macrophage functionality and response to tissue injury is not fully understood. In our present study, clodronate pre-treatment of colitic mice confirms the essential role of endogenous macrophages in bone-marrow-derived MSC (BM-MSC)-mediated clinical rescue of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. We identify that BM-MSC-secreted chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) and C-X-C motif chemokine 12 (CXCL12) cooperate as a heterodimer to upregulate IL-10 expression in CCR2+ macrophages in vitro and that CCL2 expression by MSC is required for IL-10+ polarization of intestinal and peritoneal resident macrophages in vivo. We observe that tissue macrophage IL-10 polarization in vivo is widespread involving extra-intestinal tissues and secondarily leads to bystander IL-10 expression in intestine-resident B and T cells.

This methylation-dependent splicing selectivity is associated with a limited set of signaling pathways that are affected when PRMT5 is inhibited. Specifically, we identify a conserved role for symmetric arginine dimethylation in the induction of antiviral type I and type III interferon signaling following T cell receptor and pattern recognition receptor stimulation in human T lymphocytes and undifferentiated human THP-1 monocytes.

Diseases like osteoporosis are characterized by increased bone destruction due to partially enhanced osteoclastogenesis. Here, we report that the post-translational SUMO modification is critical for regulating osteoclastogenesis. The expression of the SUMO-specific protease SENP3 is downregulated in osteoclast precursors during osteoclast differentiation. Mice with SENP3 deficiency in bone marrow-derived monocytes (BMDMs) exhibit more severe bone loss due to over-activation of osteoclasts after ovariectomy. Deleting SENP3 in BMDMs promotes osteoclast differentiation. Mechanistically, loss of SENP3 increases interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) SUMO3 modification at the K310 amino acid site, which upregulates expression of the nuclear factor of activated T cell c1 (NFATc1) and osteoclastogenesis.

Early in development, aRG express high levels of Foxp1 mRNA and protein, which promote self-renewing cell divisions and deep-layer neuron production. Foxp1 levels subsequently decline during the transition to superficial-layer neurogenesis. Sustained Foxp1 expression impedes this transition, preserving a population of cells with aRG identity throughout development and extending the early neurogenic period into postnatal life. FOXP1 expression is further associated with the initial formation and expansion of basal RG (bRG) during human corticogenesis and can promote the formation of cells exhibiting characteristics of bRG when misexpressed in the mouse cortex.

At eye-opening, the majority of visually responsive neurons are monocular. Binocular neurons emerge later with visual experience and acquire distinct visual response properties. Surprisingly, rather than mirroring the effects of visual deprivation, mice that lack the plasticity gene Arc show increased numbers of binocular neurons and a shift in ocular dominance during development. Strikingly, acutely removing Arc in the adult binocular visual cortex also increases the number of binocular neurons, suggesting that the maintenance of binocular circuits requires ongoing plasticity.

Here, we show that IQSEC3 knockdown (KD) reduced GABAergic synaptic density in vivo, suggesting that IQSEC3 is required for GABAergic synapse maintenance in vivo. We further show that IQSEC3 KD in the dentate gyrus (DG) increases seizure susceptibility and triggers selective depletion of somatostatin (SST) peptides in the DG hilus in an ARF-GEP activity-dependent manner. Strikingly, selective introduction of SST into SST interneurons in DG-specific IQSEC3-KD mice reverses GABAergic synaptic deficits.

We show that the total recycled vesicle pool is larger after plasticity induction, with the smallest terminals exhibiting the greatest relative expansion. Changes in the spatial organization of vesicles accompany potentiation including a specific increase in the number of recycled vesicles at the active zone, consistent with an ultrastructural remodeling component of synaptic strengthening.

Rabies tracing reveals that VPGlu and VPPenk neurons receive preferential innervation from upstream D1- relative to D2-expressing accumbens neurons. Chemogenetic stimulation of VPGlu neurons inhibits, whereas stimulation of VPGABA and VPPenk neurons potentiates cocaine seeking in mice withdrawn from intravenous cocaine self-administration. Calcium imaging reveals cell type-specific activity patterns when animals learn to suppress drug seeking during extinction training versus engaging in cue-induced cocaine seeking. During cued seeking, VPGABA neurons increase their overall activity, and VPPenk neurons are selectively activated around nose pokes for cocaine. In contrast, VPGlu neurons increase their spike rate following extinction training.

Optogenetic tools and quantitative cell biochemistry reveal transient oscillations in MAPK activity dependent on ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated kinase after DNA damage. MAPK inhibition alters p53 dynamics and p53-dependent gene expression after checkpoint enforcement, prolonging G2 arrest. In contrast, sustained MAPK signaling induces the phosphorylation of CDC25C, and consequently, the accumulation of pro-mitotic kinases, thereby relaxing checkpoint stringency and permitting cells to evade prolonged G2 arrest and senescence induction.

By monitoring dual reporter fluorescence during pluripotency entry, we identify a sequential order of Tet1 and Oct4 activation by proximal and distal regulatory elements. Full Tet1 activation marks an intermediate stage that accompanies predominantly repression of somatic genes, preceding full Oct4 activation, and distinguishes two waves of global DNA demethylation that target distinct genomic features but are uncoupled from transcriptional changes.

Palmitate is increased in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of overweight and obese patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment. In mice, intracerebroventricular infusion of palmitate impairs synaptic plasticity and memory.

An alanine-scanning mutagenesis discloses the DDB1 interaction motif of pUL145 that resembles the DDB1-binding interface of cellular substrate receptors of DDB1-containing ubiquitin ligases. Thus, pUL145 constitutes a viral DDB1-cullin-associated factor (vDCAF), which mimics cellular DCAFs to exploit the ubiquitin-proteasome system to impede antiviral immunity. Notably, the viral exploitation of the cullins can be targeted to restore the efficacy of the host immune response.",1,0.0,"{""Activation"": 1}"
32075764,"The inability of Nef to downmodulate the CD3-T cell receptor (TCR) complex distinguishes HIV-1 from other primate lentiviruses and may contribute to its high virulence. However, the role of this Nef function in virus-mediated immune activation and pathogenicity remains speculative. Here, we selectively disrupted this Nef activity in SIVmac239 and analyzed the consequences for the virological, immunological, and clinical outcome of infection in rhesus macaques. The inability to downmodulate CD3-TCR does not impair viral replication during acute infection but is associated with increased immune activation and antiviral gene expression. Subsequent early reversion in three of six animals suggests strong selective pressure for this Nef function and is associated with high viral loads and progression to simian AIDS. In the absence of reversions, however, viral replication and the clinical course of infection are attenuated. Thus, Nef-mediated downmodulation of CD3 dampens the inflammatory response to simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection and seems critical for efficient viral immune evasion.",1,1.5,"{""Activation"": 1}"

Similar phenotypic changes are observed outside the murine model when AIEC is grown in culture with PA as the sole carbon source; such PA exposure also results in AIEC that persists at 20-fold higher levels in vivo. RNA sequencing identifies an upregulation of genes involved in biofilm formation, stress response, metabolism, membrane integrity, and alternative carbon source utilization.

Docking simulations reveal that these molecules directly bind a specific cleft in MICU1, a key element of the MCU complex that controls channel gating. Accordingly, in MICU1-silenced or deleted cells, the inhibitory effect of the two compounds is lost. Moreover, MCU-i4 and MCU-i11 fail to inhibit mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in cells expressing a MICU1 mutated in the critical amino acids that forge the predicted binding cleft.

Mitochondrial alterations have been reported in several neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), and the comprehension of the underlying mechanisms appears crucial to understand their relationship with the pathology. Using multiple genetic, pharmacological, imaging, and biochemical approaches, we demonstrate that, in different familial AD cell models, mitochondrial ATP synthesis is affected. The defect depends on reduced mitochondrial pyruvate oxidation, due to both lower Ca2+-mediated stimulation of the Krebs cycle and dampened mitochondrial pyruvate uptake. Importantly, this latter event is linked to glycogen-synthase-kinase-3β (GSK-3β) hyper-activation, leading, in turn, to impaired recruitment of hexokinase 1 (HK1) to mitochondria, destabilization of mitochondrial-pyruvate-carrier (MPC) complexes, and decreased MPC2 protein levels. Remarkably, pharmacological GSK-3β inhibition in AD cells rescues MPC2 expression and improves mitochondrial ATP synthesis and respiration.

Ventral CA3-DLS (vCA3-DLS) projections suppress fear responses in both certain and ambiguous contexts, whereas ventral CA3-CA1 (vCA3-vCA1) projections promote fear responses in both these contexts. Lastly, using retrograde monosynaptic tracing, ex vivo electrophysiological recordings, and optogenetics, we identify a sparse population of DLS parvalbumin (PV) neurons as putative relays of dCA3-DLS projections to diverse subcortical circuits.

Here, transcription factors Lmx1a and Lmx1b are shown to be essential for midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neuron excitatory synaptic inputs and dendritic development. Strikingly, conditional knockout (cKO) of Lmx1a/b in postmitotic mDA neurons results in marked hyperactivity. In seeking Lmx1a/b target genes, we identify positively regulated Slitrk2 and negatively regulated Slitrk5. These two synaptic adhesion proteins promote excitatory and inhibitory synapses on mDA neurons, respectively. Knocking down Slitrk2 reproduces some of the Lmx1a/b cKO cellular and behavioral phenotypes, whereas Slitrk5 knockdown has opposite effects.

32075771,"Degradation of transcripts in human nuclei is primarily facilitated by the RNA exosome. To obtain substrate specificity, the exosome is aided by adaptors; in the nucleoplasm, those adaptors are the nuclear exosome-targeting (NEXT) complex and the poly(A) (pA) exosome-targeting (PAXT) connection. How these adaptors guide exosome targeting remains enigmatic. Employing high-resolution 3' end sequencing, we demonstrate that NEXT substrates arise from heterogenous and predominantly pA- 3' ends often covering kilobase-wide genomic regions. In contrast, PAXT targets harbor well-defined pA+ 3' ends defined by canonical pA site use. Irrespective of this clear division, NEXT and PAXT act redundantly in two ways: (1) regional redundancy, where the majority of exosome-targeted transcription units produce NEXT- and PAXT-sensitive RNA isoforms, and (2) isoform redundancy, where the PAXT connection ensures fail-safe decay of post-transcriptionally polyadenylated NEXT targets.

We have conducted a genome-wide CRISPR screen to identify genetic vulnerabilities that sensitize lung cancer cells to ATM inhibitors. Knockout of genes in the Fanconi anemia (FA)/BRCA pathway results in hypersensitivity to the ATM inhibitor M3541. Knockdown of either an FA gene or of ATM results in reduced double-strand break end resection, enhanced non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair, and decreased homologous recombination repair.

They contain and/or require several chaperones, such as Hsp104, Hsp16, and the Hsp40/70 couple Mas5/Ssa2. Stress granules do not assemble at mild temperatures and, therefore, are not required for PAC formation; on the contrary, PACs may serve as nucleation centers for the assembly of stress granules. In contrast to the general belief, the dominant fate of these PACs is not degradation, and the aggregated reporter can be disassembled by chaperones and recovers native structure and activity. Using mass spectrometry, we show that thermo-unstable endogenous proteins form PACs as well. In conclusion, formation of PACs during heat shock is a chaperone-mediated adaptation strategy.",0,0.0,{}

Here, we address the synaptic function of C-terminal binding protein 1 (CtBP1), a ubiquitous regulator of gene expression and membrane trafficking in cultured hippocampal neurons. In the absence of CtBP1, synapses form in greater density and show changes in SV distribution and size. The increased basal neurotransmission and enhanced synaptic depression could be attributed to a higher vesicular release probability and a smaller fraction of release-competent SVs, respectively. Rescue experiments with specifically targeted constructs indicate that, while synaptogenesis and release probability are controlled by nuclear CtBP1, the efficient recycling of SVs relies on its synaptic expression. The ability of presynaptic CtBP1 to facilitate compensatory endocytosis depends on its membrane-fission activity and the activation of the lipid-metabolizing enzyme PLD1. Thus, CtBP1 regulates SV recycling by promoting a permissive lipid environment for compensatory endocytosis.",0,0.0,{}

MDM2 also has pro-oncogenic roles in cells, tissues, and animals that are independent of p53. There is less information available about p53-independent roles of MDMX or the MDM2-MDMX complex. We found that MDM2 and MDMX facilitate ferroptosis in cells with or without p53. Using small molecules, RNA interference reagents, and mutant forms of MDMX, we found that MDM2 and MDMX, likely working in part as a complex, normally facilitate ferroptotic death. We observed that MDM2 and MDMX alter the lipid profile of cells to favor ferroptosis. Inhibition of MDM2 or MDMX leads to increased levels of FSP1 protein and a consequent increase in the levels of coenzyme Q10, an endogenous lipophilic antioxidant. This suggests that MDM2 and MDMX normally prevent cells from mounting an adequate defense against lipid peroxidation and thereby promote ferroptosis. Moreover, we found that PPARα activity is essential for MDM2 and MDMX to promote ferroptosis, suggesting that the MDM2-MDMX complex regulates lipids through altering PPARα activity. These findings reveal the complexity of cellular responses to MDM2 and MDMX and suggest that MDM2-MDMX inhibition might be useful for preventing degenerative diseases involving ferroptosis.

The linear order of chromosomal loci is maintained in the axial cores, whose formation requires MukBEF ATP hydrolysis. Axial core structure in non-replicating chromosomes is predominantly linear (1 μm) but becomes circular (1.5 μm) in the absence of MatP because of its failure to displace MukBEF from the 800 kbp replication termination region (ter).

To understand the molecular interactions underlying these functions, we used solution biophysics to characterize binding of δ1- and δ2-protocadherins, determined crystal structures of ectodomain complexes from each family, and assessed ectodomain assembly in reconstituted intermembrane junctions by cryoelectron tomography (cryo-ET). Homophilic trans (cell-cell) interactions were preferred for all δ-protocadherins, with additional weaker heterophilic interactions observed exclusively within each subfamily. As expected, δ1- and δ2-protocadherin trans dimers formed through antiparallel EC1-EC4 interfaces, like clustered protocadherins. However, no ectodomain-mediated cis (same-cell) interactions were detectable in solution; consistent with this, cryo-ET of reconstituted junctions revealed dense assemblies lacking the characteristic order observed for clustered protocadherins.

32101744,"In Drosophila, transposon-silencing piRNAs are derived from heterochromatic clusters and a subset of euchromatic transposon insertions, which are bound by the Rhino-Deadlock-Cutoff complex. The HP1 homolog Rhino binds to Deadlock, which recruits TRF2 to promote non-canonical transcription from both genomic strands. Cuff function is less well understood, but this Rai1 homolog shows hallmarks of adaptive evolution, which can remodel functional interactions within host defense systems. Supporting this hypothesis, Drosophila simulans Cutoff is a dominant-negative allele when expressed in Drosophila melanogaster, in which it traps Deadlock, TRF2, and the conserved transcriptional co-repressor CtBP in stable complexes. Cutoff functions with Rhino and Deadlock to drive non-canonical transcription. In contrast, CtBP suppresses canonical transcription of transposons and promoters flanking the major germline clusters, and canonical transcription interferes with downstream non-canonical transcription and piRNA production. Adaptive evolution thus targets interactions among Cutoff, TRF2, and CtBP that balance canonical and non-canonical piRNA precursor transcription.",0,0.0,{}

Heterochromatin can be assembled by multiple pathways, including RNAi and RNA surveillance. We identified factors that form heterochromatin using dense profiles of transposable element integration in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The candidates include a large number of essential proteins such as four canonical mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation factors. We find that Iss1, a subunit of the poly(A) polymerase module, plays a role in forming heterochromatin in centromere repeats that is independent of RNAi. Genome-wide maps reveal that Iss1 accumulates at genes regulated by RNA surveillance. Iss1 interacts with RNA surveillance factors Mmi1 and Rrp6, and importantly, Iss1 contributes to RNA elimination that forms heterochromatin at meiosis genes. Our profile of transposable element integration supports the model that a network of mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation factors coordinates RNA surveillance, including the mechanism that forms heterochromatin at meiotic genes.",0,0.0,{}

To date, it has been assumed that the enzymes function independently within the complex. Now, we report the assembly of the ternary complex. Using both structural and functional studies, we show that the activity of the two enzymes is closely coupled and that the complex can exist in at least two distinct states with different kinetics.

Here we identify class IIa HDACs as key molecular links between Toll-like receptor (TLR)-inducible aerobic glycolysis and macrophage inflammatory responses. A proteomic screen identified the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase M isoform 2 (Pkm2) as a partner of proinflammatory Hdac7 in murine macrophages. Myeloid-specific Hdac7 overexpression in transgenic mice amplifies lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-inducible lactate and promotes a glycolysis-associated inflammatory signature. Conversely, pharmacological or genetic targeting of Hdac7 and other class IIa HDACs attenuates LPS-inducible glycolysis and accompanying inflammatory responses in macrophages. We show that an Hdac7-Pkm2 complex acts as an immunometabolism signaling hub, whereby Pkm2 deacetylation at lysine 433 licenses its proinflammatory functions. Disrupting this complex suppresses inflammatory responses in vitro and in vivo.

Additionally, the tumor suppressor PTEN is lost in ∼10% of patients, and in mouse models, this dramatically accelerates tumor progression. While oncogenic KRAS and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) cause divergent metabolic phenotypes individually, how they synergize to promote tumor metabolic alterations and dependencies remains unknown. We show that in KRAS-driven murine PDAC cells, loss of Pten strongly enhances both mTOR signaling and macropinocytosis. Protein scavenging alleviates sensitivity to mTOR inhibition by rescuing AKT phosphorylation at serine 473 and consequently cell proliferation. Combined inhibition of mTOR and lysosomal processing of internalized protein eliminates the macropinocytosis-mediated resistance. Our results indicate that mTORC2, rather than mTORC1, is an important regulator of protein scavenging and that protein-mediated resistance could explain the lack of effectiveness of mTOR inhibitors in certain genetic backgrounds. Concurrent inhibition of mTOR and protein scavenging might be a valuable therapeutic approach.",3,7.5,"{""Inhibition"": 3}"

In solid tumors, however, ILC2s constitute a relatively small proportion of immune cells.

Melanomas with reduced lactate production (LDHAlow) are growth delayed and typified by an increased number of ILC2s compared with control tumors. Upon IL-33 stimulation, ILC2s accompanied by eosinophils more effectively restrain the growth of LDHAlow tumors than control melanomas. Furthermore, database analysis reveals a negative correlation between the expression of LDHA and markers associated with ILC2s and the association of high expression of IL33 and an eosinophil marker SIGLEC8 with better overall survival in human cutaneous melanoma patients.

We stringently defined a list of direct RelA target genes by integrating physical (chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing [ChIP-seq]) and functional (RNA sequencing [RNA-seq] in knockouts) datasets. We then dissected each gene's regulatory strategy by testing RelA variants in a primary-cell genetic-complementation assay. All endogenous target genes require RelA to make DNA-base-specific contacts, and none are activatable by the DNA binding domain alone. However, endogenous target genes differ widely in how they employ the two transactivation domains. Through model-aided analysis of the dynamic time-course data, we reveal the gene-specific synergy and redundancy of TA1 and TA2. Given that post-translational modifications control TA1 activity and intrinsic affinity for coactivators determines TA2 activity, the differential TA logics suggests context-dependent versus context-independent control of endogenous RelA-target genes. Although some inflammatory initiators appear to require co-stimulatory TA1 activation, inflammatory resolvers are a part of the NF-κB RelA core response.",0,0.0,{}
32101751,"TRAF-interacting protein with a forkhead-associated domain B (TIFAB) is implicated in myeloid malignancies with deletion of chromosome 5q. Employing a combination of proteomic and genetic approaches, we find that TIFAB regulates ubiquitin-specific peptidase 15 (USP15) ubiquitin hydrolase activity. Expression of TIFAB in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) permits USP15 signaling to substrates, including MDM2 and KEAP1, and mitigates p53 expression. Consequently, TIFAB-deficient HSPCs exhibit compromised USP15 signaling and are sensitized to hematopoietic stress by derepression of p53. In MLL-AF9 leukemia, deletion of TIFAB increases p53 signaling and correspondingly decreases leukemic cell function and development of leukemia. Restoring USP15 expression partially rescues the function of TIFAB-deficient MLL-AF9 cells. Conversely, elevated TIFAB represses p53, increases leukemic progenitor function, and correlates with MLL gene expression programs in leukemia patients.

NEDD4-1 undergoes lysine 29 (K29)-linked auto-ubiquitination at K1279 and serves as a scaffold for recruiting the ubiquitin-specific protease 13 (USP13) to form an NEDD4-1-USP13 deubiquitination complex, which subsequently stabilizes VPS34 to promote autophagy through removing the K48-linked poly-ubiquitin chains from VPS34 at K419. Knockout of either NEDD4-1 or USP13 increased K48-linked ubiquitination and degradation of VPS34, thus attenuating the formation of the autophagosome.

32101754,"We study punctate adherens junctions (pAJs) to determine how short-lived cadherin clusters and relatively stable actin bundles interact despite differences in dynamics. We show that pAJ-linked bundles consist of two distinct regions-the bundle stalk (AJ-BS) and a tip (AJ-BT) positioned between cadherin clusters and the stalk. The tip differs from the stalk in a number of ways: it is devoid of the actin-bundling protein calponin, and exhibits a much faster F-actin turnover rate. While F-actin in the stalk displays centripetal movement, the F-actin in the tip is immobile. The F-actin turnover in both the tip and stalk is dependent on cadherin cluster stability, which in turn is regulated by F-actin. The close bidirectional coupling between the stability of cadherin and associated F-actin shows how pAJs, and perhaps other AJs, allow cells to sense and coordinate the dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton in neighboring cells-a mechanism we term ""dynasensing.""",0,0.0,{}

Embedding this nucleating core in a non-native N-rich sequence that does not form amyloid but acts as an entropic bristle quadruples seeding efficiency.

Similar to stk, two ckx7 mutants possess shorter fruits than wild type. Quantification of CKs reveals that stk and ckx7 mutants have high CK levels, which negatively control cell expansion during fruit development, compromising fruit growth. Overexpression of CKX7 partially complements the stk fruit phenotype, confirming a role for CK degradation in fruit development.

Early embryonic chromosomes organized into an unconventional barbell-like configuration, with two densely folded B compartments separated by a central A compartment. Upon gastrulation, this conformation matured into conventional A/B compartments. We used unsupervised clustering to uncover subpopulations with differing folding properties and variable positioning of compartment boundaries.

ADAM10 is a ""molecular scissor"" that proteolytically cleaves the extracellular region from >100 substrates, including Notch, amyloid precursor protein, cadherins, growth factors, and chemokines. ADAM10 has been recently proposed to function as six distinct scissors with different substrates, depending on its association with one of six regulatory tetraspanins, termed TspanC8s. However, it remains unclear to what degree ADAM10 function critically depends on a TspanC8 partner, and a lack of monoclonal antibodies specific for most TspanC8s has hindered investigation of this question. To address this knowledge gap, here we designed an immunogen to generate the first monoclonal antibodies targeting Tspan15, a model TspanC8. The immunogen was created in an ADAM10-knockout mouse cell line stably overexpressing human Tspan15, because we hypothesized that expression in this cell line would expose epitopes that are normally blocked by ADAM10. Following immunization of mice, this immunogen strategy generated four Tspan15 antibodies. Using these antibodies, we show that endogenous Tspan15 and ADAM10 co-localize on the cell surface, that ADAM10 is the principal Tspan15-interacting protein, that endogenous Tspan15 expression requires ADAM10 in cell lines and primary cells, and that a synthetic ADAM10/Tspan15 fusion protein is a functional scissor. Furthermore, two of the four antibodies impaired ADAM10/Tspan15 activity. These findings suggest that Tspan15 directly interacts with ADAM10 in a functional scissor complex.",0,0.0,{}

Genome-wide association studies have identified dominant LRRK2 alleles that predispose their carriers to late-onset idiotypic Parkinson's disease (PD) and also to autoimmune disorders such as Crohn's disease. Considerable evidence indicates that PD initiation and progression involve activation of innate immune functions in microglia, which are brain-resident macrophages. Here we asked whether LRRK2 modifies inflammatory signaling and how this modification might contribute to PD and Crohn's disease. We used RNA-Seq-based high-resolution transcriptomics to compare gene expression in activated primary macrophages derived from WT and Lrrk2 knockout mice. Remarkably, expression of a single gene, Rap guanine nucleotide exchange factor 3 (Rapgef3), was strongly up-regulated in the absence of LRRK2 and down-regulated in its presence. We observed similar regulation of Rapgef3 expression in cells treated with a highly specific inhibitor of LRRK2 protein kinase activity. Rapgef3 encodes an exchange protein, activated by cAMP 1 (EPAC-1), a guanine nucleotide exchange factor that activates the small GTPase Rap-1. Rap-1 mediates cell adhesion, polarization, and directional motility, and our results indicate that LRRK2 modulates chemotaxis of microglia and macrophages. Dominant PD-associated LRRK2 alleles may suppress EPAC-1 activity, further restricting motility and preventing efficient migration of microglia to sites of neuronal damage.

Here, we show how Tet1 plays a pivotal role upstream of germ layer lineage bifurcation. During the transition from naive pluripotency to lineage priming, a global reconfiguration redistributes Tet1 from Oct4-cobound promoters to distal regulatory elements at lineage differentiation genes, which are distinct from high-affinity sites engaged by Oct4. An altered chromatin landscape in Tet1-deficient primed epiblast-like cells is associated with enhanced Oct4 expression and binding to Nodal and Wnt target genes, resulting in collaborative signals that enhance mesendodermal and inhibit neuroectodermal gene expression during lineage segregation. A permissive role for Tet1 in neural fate induction involves Zic2-dependent engagement at neural target genes at lineage priming, is dependent on the signaling environment during gastrulation, and impacts neural tube closure after gastrulation.

We generated Rab39b knockout (KO) mice and found that they exhibited cortical neurogenesis impairment, macrocephaly, and hallmark ASD behaviors, which resembled patient phenotypes. We also produced mutant human cerebral organoids that were substantially enlarged due to the overproliferation and impaired differentiation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs), which resemble neurodevelopmental deficits in KO mice. Mechanistic studies reveal that RAB39b interacts with PI3K components and its deletion promotes PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling in NPCs of mouse cortex and cerebral organoids. The mTOR activity is robustly enhanced in mutant outer radial glia cells (oRGs), a subtype of NPCs barely detectable in rodents but abundant in human brains. Inhibition of AKT signaling rescued enlarged organoid sizes and NPC overproliferation caused by RAB39b mutations.

The MutSγ complex, Msh4-Msh5, facilitates crossing over by binding and stabilizing nascent recombination intermediates. We show that these activities are governed by regulated proteolysis.

Activation of MutSγ requires the Dbf4-dependent kinase Cdc7 (DDK), which directly phosphorylates and thereby neutralizes the Msh4 degron. Genetic requirements for Msh4 phosphorylation indicate that DDK targets MutSγ only after it has bound to nascent joint molecules (JMs) in the context of synapsing chromosomes. Overexpression studies confirm that the steady-state level of Msh4, not phosphorylation per se, is the critical determinant for crossing over.

The integration of MAGs and 16S rRNA gene data allows more accurate prediction of functional profiles of communities than predictions based on 16S rRNA amplicons alone. Accompanying iMGMC, we provide a set of MAGs representing 1,296 gut bacteria obtained through complementary assembly strategies.

32130897,Netherton syndrome (NS) is a monogenic skin disease resulting from loss of function of lymphoepithelial Kazal-type-related protease inhibitor (LEKTI-1). In this study we examine if bacteria residing on the skin are influenced by the loss of LEKTI-1 and if interaction between this human gene and resident bacteria contributes to skin disease. Shotgun sequencing of the skin microbiome demonstrates that lesional skin of NS subjects is dominated by Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis). Isolates of either species from NS subjects are able to induce skin inflammation and barrier damage on mice. These microbes promote skin inflammation in the setting of LEKTI-1 deficiency due to excess proteolytic activity promoted by S. aureus phenol-soluble modulin α as well as increased bacterial proteases staphopain A and B from S. aureus or EcpA from S. epidermidis. These findings demonstrate the critical need for maintaining homeostasis of host and microbial proteases to prevent a human skin disease.,0,0.0,{}
32130898,"Secondary bacterial infections often complicate viral respiratory infections. We hypothesize that perturbation of the gut microbiota during influenza A virus (IAV) infection might favor respiratory bacterial superinfection. Sublethal infection with influenza transiently alters the composition and fermentative activity of the gut microbiota in mice. These changes are attributed in part to reduced food consumption. Fecal transfer experiments demonstrate that the IAV-conditioned microbiota compromises lung defenses against pneumococcal infection. In mechanistic terms, reduced production of the predominant short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) acetate affects the bactericidal activity of alveolar macrophages. Following treatment with acetate, mice colonized with the IAV-conditioned microbiota display reduced bacterial loads. In the context of influenza infection, acetate supplementation reduces, in a free fatty acid receptor 2 (FFAR2)-dependent manner, local and systemic bacterial loads. This translates into reduced lung pathology and improved survival rates of double-infected mice. Lastly, pharmacological activation of the SCFA receptor FFAR2 during influenza reduces bacterial superinfection.",2,1.5,"{""Inhibition"": 2}"

This virus profoundly suppresses MR1 cell surface expression and targets the molecule for proteasomal degradation, whereas ligand-induced cell surface expression of MR1 prior to infection enables MR1 to escape HSV-1-dependent targeting. HSV-1 downregulation of MR1 is dependent on de novo viral gene expression, and we identify the Us3 viral gene product as functioning to target MR1. Furthermore, HSV-1 downregulation of MR1 disrupts MAIT T cell receptor (TCR) activation. Accordingly, virus-mediated targeting of MR1 defines an immunomodulatory strategy that functionally disrupts the MR1-MAIT TCR axis.",3,6.0,"{""Inhibition"": 1, ""Activation"": 2}"

Heavy chain variable region (VH) usage, somatic mutation frequency replacement-to-silent ratio, and CDR3 property changes, reflecting consecutive selection of highly antigen-specific, low cross-reactive antibody variants, all demonstrate that CD27dull and CD27bright MBCs represent sequential MBC developmental stages, and stringent antigen-driven pressure selects CD27dull into the CD27bright MBC pool. Dynamics of human MBCs are exploited in pregnancy, when 50% of maternal MBCs are lost and CD27dull MBCs transit to the more differentiated CD27bright stage. In the postpartum period, the maternal MBC pool is replenished by the expansion of persistent CD27dull clones.

Whole genome sequencing reveals microevolution of hemoglobin binding and lipooligosaccharide (LOS) biosynthesis genes, suggesting that adaptation of these systems is critical for infection. These OM-adapted strains promote increased biofilm formation, inflammation, stromal fibrosis, and an increased propensity to form intracellular bacterial communities (IBCs).

ILCs, not T and B cells, are required for the development of pericarditis. ILC2s transferred to the heart of Rag2-/-Il2rg-/- mice restore their susceptibility to eosinophil infiltration. Moreover, ILC2s direct cardiac fibroblasts to produce eotaxin-1. We also find that eosinophils reside in the mediastinal cavity and that eosinophils transferred to the mediastinal cavity of eosinophil-deficient ΔdblGATA1 mice following IL-33 treatment migrate to the heart. Thus, the serous cavities may serve as a reservoir of cardiac-infiltrating eosinophils.

We also show elevation of Csf2 transcripts and of several CSF-2 downstream targets in the brains of ALSP patients, demonstrating that the mechanisms identified in the mouse model are functional in humans. Our data provide insights into the mechanisms underlying ALSP.

Using dual patch-clamp recordings from interneurons and Purkinje cells in vivo, we probe the spatiotemporal interactions between these circuit elements. We show that single interneuron spikes can potently inhibit Purkinje cell output, depending on interneuron location. Climbing fiber input activates many interneurons via glutamate spillover but results in inhibition of those interneurons that inhibit the same Purkinje cell receiving the climbing fiber input, forming a disinhibitory motif. These interneuron circuits are engaged during sensory processing, creating diverse pathway-specific response functions.

We investigate this by comparing the anatomy and function of two commissural inhibitory neuron types, dI6dmrt3a and V0d, derived from the pd6 and p0 progenitor domains, respectively. We find that both of these commissural neuron types have monosynaptic, inhibitory connections to neuronal populations active during fictive swimming, supporting their role in providing inhibition to the contralateral side. V0d neurons tend to fire during faster and stronger movements, while dI6dmrt3a neurons tend to fire more consistently during normal fictive swimming. Ablation of dI6dmrt3a neurons leads to an impairment of left-right alternating activity through abnormal co-activation of ventral root neurons on both sides of the spinal cord. Our results suggest that dI6dmrt3a and V0d commissural inhibitory neurons synergistically provide inhibition to the opposite side across different swimming behaviors.",0,0.0,{}

We also identify Foxp1-regulated target genes within distinct cell types and connect these molecular changes to functional and behavioral deficits relevant to phenotypes described in patients with FOXP1 loss-of-function mutations.

Here, we show that the firing activity of anorexigenic POMC neurons located in the hypothalamus is increased after a standard meal. Postprandial hyperactivity of POMC neurons relies on synaptic plasticity that engages pre-synaptic mechanisms, which does not involve structural remodeling of synapses but retraction of glial coverage. These functional and morphological neuroglial changes are triggered by postprandial hyperglycemia. Chemogenetically induced glial retraction on POMC neurons is sufficient to increase POMC activity and modify meal patterns. These findings indicate that synaptic plasticity within the melanocortin system happens at the timescale of meals and likely contributes to short-term control of food intake. Interestingly, these effects are lost with a high-fat meal, suggesting that neuroglial plasticity of POMC neurons is involved in the satietogenic properties of foods.",0,0.0,{}

Integrating PPARα and PPARγ genomic occupancy with cold-responsive BAT transcriptomes identifies a subset of 16 genes with potential relevance to BAT function.

The molecular mechanisms coordinating preprotein recognition by TIM23 in the intermembrane space (IMS) with PAM activation in the matrix are unknown. Here we show that subsequent to presequence recognition in the IMS, the Tim50 matrix domain facilitates the recruitment of the coupling factor Pam17. Next, the IMS domain of Tim50 promotes PAM recruitment to TIM23. Finally, the Tim50 transmembrane segment stimulates the matrix-directed import-driving force exerted by PAM.

Our results suggest that an E2f/Rb transcriptional network is central to the divergence of these two populations and that remnants of the differences acquired during the neonatal period remain in adult cardiomyocytes. Moreover, inducing binucleation by genetically blocking the ability of cardiomyocytes to complete cytokinesis leads to a reduction in E2f target gene expression, directly linking the E2f pathway with nucleation.

Here, we report that Wss1 provides cells tolerance to replication stress by directly degrading core histone subunits that non-specifically and non-covalently bind to single-stranded DNA. Unlike Wss1-dependent proteolysis of covalent DNA-protein crosslinks, proteolysis of histones does not require Cdc48 nor SUMO-binding activities.

We show that the sRNA sequence dictates the target repertoire, as point mutations in the sRNA shift the target set correspondingly. We distinguish two subsets of targets: targets showing changes in expression levels under overexpression of their sRNA regulator and unaffected targets that interact more sporadically with the sRNA. These differences among targets are associated with their Hfq occupancy, rather than with the sRNA-target base-pairing potential. Our results suggest that competition among targets over Hfq binding plays a major role in the regulatory outcome, possibly awarding targets with higher Hfq binding efficiency an advantage in the competition over binding to the sRNA.",0,0.0,{}

The introduction of a human Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD)-inducing mutation into the C. elegans lamin (LMN-Y59C), recapitulates many muscular dystrophy phenotypes, and correlates with hyper-sequestration of a heterochromatic array at the nuclear periphery in muscle cells. Using muscle-specific emerin Dam-ID in worms, we monitored the effects of the mutation on endogenous chromatin.

The coupling of the LMN-Y59C mutation with the ablation of CEC-4, a chromodomain protein that anchors H3K9-methylated chromatin at the nuclear envelope (NE), suppressed the muscle-associated disease phenotypes. Deletion of cec-4 also rescued LMN-Y59C-linked alterations in chromatin organization and some changes in transcription. Sequences that changed position in the LMN-Y59C mutant, are enriched for E2F (EFL-2)-binding sites, consistent with previous studies suggesting that altered Rb-E2F interaction with lamin A may contribute to muscle dysfunction.

Here, we find that trans-2-hexadecenal (t-2-hex), previously implicated in regulating BAX-mediated apoptosis, does so by direct covalent reaction with C126, which is located on the surface of BAX at the junction of its α5/α6 core hydrophobic hairpin. The application of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, specialized t-2-hex-containing liposomes, and BAX mutational studies in mitochondria and cells reveals structure-function insights into the mechanism by which covalent lipidation at the mitochondria sensitizes direct BAX activation. The functional role of BAX lipidation as a control point of mitochondrial apoptosis could provide a therapeutic strategy for BAX modulation by chemical modification of C126.",1,1.5,"{""Activation"": 1}"
32160533,"Target of Rapamycin Complex 1 (TORC1) signaling promotes growth and aging. Inhibition of TORC1 leads to reduced protein translation, which promotes longevity. TORC1-dependent post-transcriptional regulation of protein translation has been well studied, while analogous transcriptional regulation is less understood. Here we screen fission yeast mutants for resistance to Torin1, which inhibits TORC1 and cell growth. Cells lacking the GATA factor Gaf1 (gaf1Δ) grow normally even in high doses of Torin1. The gaf1Δ mutation shortens the chronological lifespan of non-dividing cells and diminishes Torin1-mediated longevity. Expression profiling and genome-wide binding experiments show that upon TORC1 inhibition, Gaf1 directly upregulates genes for small-molecule metabolic pathways and indirectly represses genes for protein translation. Surprisingly, Gaf1 binds to and downregulates the tRNA genes, so it also functions as a transcription factor for RNA polymerase III. Thus, Gaf1 controls the transcription of both protein-coding and tRNA genes to inhibit translation and growth downstream of TORC1.",4,1.5,"{""Inhibition"": 4}"

The mechanisms underlying this effect are unclear and controversial. Theoretical calculations suggest that the heat produced by RF fields is likely orders of magnitude weaker than needed for channel activation. Using the FeRIC (Ferritin iron Redistribution to Ion Channels) system, we have uncovered a mechanism of activation of ferritin-tagged channels via a biochemical pathway initiated by RF disturbance of ferritin and mediated by ferritin-associated iron. We show that, in cells expressing TRPVFeRIC channels, RF increases the levels of the labile iron pool in a ferritin-dependent manner. Free iron participates in chemical reactions, producing reactive oxygen species and oxidized lipids that ultimately activate the TRPVFeRIC channels. This biochemical pathway predicts a similar RF-induced activation of other lipid-sensitive TRP channels and may guide future magnetogenetic designs.",3,0.0,"{""IncreaseAmount"": 1, ""Activation"": 2}"

Neurons employ synaptic vesicle priming proteins of the CAPS and Munc13 families to shape short-term plasticity in vitro, but the relevance of this phenomenon for information processing in the intact brain is unknown. By combining sensory stimulation with in vivo patch-clamp recordings in anesthetized mice, we show that genetic deletion of CAPS-1 in thalamic neurons results in more rapid adaptation of sensory-evoked subthreshold responses in layer 4 neurons of the primary visual cortex. Optogenetic experiments in acute brain slices further reveal that the enhanced adaptation is caused by more pronounced short-term synaptic depression.

For decades, this sharp contrast has spawned fundamental questions about the origin of functional architectures in visual cortex. However, it is unknown whether these patterns reflect disparate developmental mechanisms across mammalian taxa or simply originate from variation of biological parameters under a universal development process. In this work, after the analysis of data from eight mammalian species, we show that cortical organization is predictable by a single factor, the retino-cortical mapping ratio. Groups of species with or without columnar clustering are distinguished by the feedforward sampling ratio, and model simulations with controlled mapping conditions reproduce both types of organization. Prediction from the Nyquist theorem explains this parametric division of the patterns with high accuracy.

DTECT enables the accurate quantification of marker-free precision genome editing events introduced by CRISPR-dependent homology-directed repair, base editing, or prime editing in various biological systems, such as mammalian cell lines, organoids, and tissues.

SINE, L1, and low-complexity repeats demarcate distinct functional categories of genes and may dictate the time and level of gene expression by providing binding sites for different regulatory proteins. Importantly, imaging and sequencing analysis show that L1 repeats sequester a large set of genes with specialized functions in nucleolus- and lamina-associated inactive domains that are depleted of SINE repeats. In addition, L1 transcripts bind extensively to its DNA in embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Depletion of L1 RNA in ESCs leads to relocation of L1-enriched chromosomal segments from inactive domains to the nuclear interior and de-repression of L1-associated genes.

We investigate, in fission yeast, telomere replication dynamics in telomerase-negative cells to unmask problems associated with telomere replication. Two-dimensional gel analysis reveals that replication of telomeres is severely impaired and correlates with an accumulation of replication intermediates that arises from stalled and collapsed forks. In the absence of telomerase, Rad51, Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN) complex, and its co-factor CtIPCtp1 become critical to maintain telomeres, indicating that homologous recombination processes these intermediates to facilitate fork restart. We further show that a catalytically dead mutant of telomerase prevents Ku recruitment to telomeres, suggesting that telomerase and Ku both compete for the binding of telomeric-free DNA ends that are likely to originate from a reversed fork. We infer that Ku removal at collapsed telomeric forks allows telomerase to repair broken telomeres, thereby shielding telomeres from homologous recombination.",1,0.0,"{""Activation"": 1}"

Here, we report an essential and cell-cycle-dependent ORC ""dimerization cycle"" that plays three fundamental roles in the regulation of DNA replication: providing a symmetric platform to load the symmetric pre-RCs, marking and protecting the nascent sister replication origins for the next licensing, and playing a crucial role to prevent origin re-licensing within the same cell cycle.",0,0.0,{}
32160541,"Overlapping genes are prevalent in most genomes, but the extent to which this organization influences regulatory events operating at the post-transcriptional level remains unclear. Studying the cen and ik2 genes of Drosophila melanogaster, which are convergently transcribed as cis-natural antisense transcripts (cis-NATs) with overlapping 3' UTRs, we found that their encoded mRNAs strikingly co-localize to centrosomes. These transcripts physically interact in a 3' UTR-dependent manner, and the targeting of ik2 requires its 3' UTR sequence and the presence of cen mRNA, which serves as the main driver of centrosomal co-localization. The cen transcript undergoes localized translation in proximity to centrosomes, and its localization is perturbed by polysome-disrupting drugs. By interrogating global fractionation-sequencing datasets generated from Drosophila and human cellular models, we find that RNAs expressed as cis-NATs tend to co-localize to specific subcellular fractions.

In contrast, we find that RIN-bound mRNAs, which encode core components of the transcription, splicing, and translation machinery, are short, stable, and highly translated. We show that RIN is associated with polysomes and provide evidence for a direct role for RIN and its human homologs in stabilizing and upregulating the translation of their target mRNAs. We propose that when cells are stressed, the resulting incorporation of RIN/G3BPs into SGs sequesters them away from their short target mRNAs.

Attenuating MYC expression reverses mitotic defects, even in established tumor cell lines, indicating an ongoing role for MYC in CIN. MYC reprograms mitotic gene expression, and we identify TPX2 to be permissive for spindle assembly in MYC-high cells. TPX2 depletion blocks mitotic progression, induces cell death, and prevents tumor growth. Further elevating TPX2 expression reduces mitotic defects in MYC-high cells. MYC and TPX2 expression may be useful biomarkers to stratify patients for anti-mitotic therapies.

In glioblastoma cells treated with EGFR and MET inhibitors, SPRY2 expression is initially suppressed but eventually rebounds due to NF-κB pathway activation, resultant autocrine FGFR activation, and reactivation of ERK, which controls SPRY2 transcription. In cells where FGFR autocrine signaling does not occur and ERK does not reactivate, or in which ERK reactivates but SPRY2 cannot be expressed, EGFR and MET inhibitors are more effective at promoting death.

In vivo inactivation of ABCA1 or expression of ABCA1 mutants in hematopoietic cells in the setting of Tet2 loss demonstrates a myelosuppressive function of ABCA1.

Molecular profiling by RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, and metabolomics revealed that glycolytic and pentose phosphate pathway genes are induced by dERR, and their reduced expression in mutants is accompanied by elevated glycolytic intermediates, reduced TCA cycle intermediates, and reduced levels of long chain fatty acids. Unexpectedly, we found that the central pathways of energy metabolism, including glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and electron transport chain, are coordinately induced at the transcriptional level in mid-pupae and maintained into adulthood, and this response is partially dependent on dERR, leading to the metabolic defects observed in mutants.

As development proceeds, gradual decline in SMAD activities from ventral to dorsal progenitors progressively alleviates suppression on Gsx1 and allows transition of progenitor fate. Manipulating the BMP signaling dynamics can either lead to an immediate halt or rapid acceleration of the temporal fate switch, thus unbalancing the generation of distinct neuronal populations. Our study thus demonstrates that neural progenitors possess inherent competence to produce late-born neurons, yet identity transition is mechanistically executed by precisely timed and positioned reduction of repressors for late-fate determinants.",2,3.0,"{""Inhibition"": 2}"
32187535,"Normally, opioids function in a receptor-dependent manner. They bind to opioid receptors, activate or inhibit receptor activation, and subsequently modulate downstream signal transduction. However, the complex functions of opioids and the low expression of opioid receptors and their endogenous peptide agonists in neural stem cells (NSCs) suggest that some opioids may also modulate NSCs via a receptor-independent pathway. In the current study, two opioids, morphine and naloxone, are demonstrated to facilitate NSC proliferation via a receptor-independent and ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase 1 (TET1)-dependent pathway. Morphine and naloxone penetrate cell membrane, bind to TET1 protein via three key residues (1,880-1,882), and subsequently result in facilitated proliferation of NSCs. In addition, the two opioids also inhibit the DNA demethylation ability of TET1. In summary, the current results connect opioids and DNA demethylation directly at least in NSCs and extend our understanding on both opioids and NSCs.",0,0.0,{}

To determine whether ultrastructural differences co-define this functional heterogeneity, we combine hippocampal organotypic slice cultures, high-pressure freezing, freeze substitution, and 3D-electron tomography to compare two functionally distinct synapses: hippocampal Schaffer collateral and mossy fiber synapses. We find that mossy fiber synapses, which exhibit a lower release probability and stronger short-term facilitation than Schaffer collateral synapses, harbor lower numbers of docked synaptic vesicles at active zones and a second pool of possibly tethered vesicles in their vicinity.

Each of these populations of neurons is proposed to integrate a unique combination of thousands of local and long-range synaptic inputs, but the extent to which this occurs remains unknown. To address this, we employ monosynaptic rabies tracing to study the input-output relationship of vS neurons. Analysis of brain-wide inputs reveals quantitative input differences that could be explained by a combination of both the identity of the downstream target and the spatial location of the postsynaptic neurons within vS. These results support a model of combined topographical and output-defined connectivity of vS inputs.

TDP-43M337V mice, which show neuromuscular pathology without motor neuron loss, display axonal transport perturbations manifesting between 1.5 and 3 months and preceding symptom onset. Contrastingly, despite 20% motor neuron loss, transport remained largely unaffected in FusΔ14/+ mice.

Mechanisms of such unresponsiveness are well studied in lipopolysaccharide tolerance; however, whether mechanisms of tolerance limit innate immunity during virus infection remains unknown. Here, we find that infection with the highly cytopathic vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) leads to innate anergy for several days. Innate anergy is associated with induction of apoptotic cells, which activates the Tyro3, Axl, and Mertk (TAM) receptor Mertk and induces high levels of interleukin-10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β). Lack of Mertk in Mertk-/- mice prevents induction of IL-10 and TGF-β, resulting in abrogation of innate anergy. Innate anergy is associated with enhanced VSV replication and poor survival after infection. Mechanistically, Mertk signaling upregulates suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) and SOCS3.

The fecal transfer induces despair-like behavior, decreases neurogenesis in the hippocampus (HpC), and impairs the antidepressant and neurogenic effects of a standard selective serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitor, fluoxetine (FLX). These effects are paralleled by deficits in 5-HT bioavailability, biosynthesis, and reuptake in the HpC.

Our data suggest that the stability of each subunit is differentially regulated. In WRB's absence, CAML folds incorrectly, causing aberrant exposure of a hydrophobic transmembrane domain to the ER lumen. When present, WRB can correct the topology of CAML both in vitro and in cells. In contrast, WRB can independently fold correctly but is still degraded in the absence of CAML.

32187544,"Understanding the mechanisms of activity-dependent gene transcription underlying adaptive behaviors is challenging at neuronal-subtype resolution. Using cell-type specific molecular analysis in agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons, we reveal that the profound hunger-induced transcriptional changes greatly depend on plant homeodomain finger protein 6 (PHF6), a transcriptional repressor enriched in AgRP neurons. Loss of PHF6 in the satiated mice results in a hunger-state-shifting transcriptional profile, while hunger fails to further induce a rapid and robust activity-dependent gene transcription in PHF6-deficient AgRP neurons. We reveal that PHF6 binds to the promoters of a subset of immediate-early genes (IEGs) and that this chromatin binding is dynamically regulated by hunger state. Depletion of PHF6 decreases hunger-driven feeding motivation and makes the mice resistant to body weight gain under repetitive fasting-refeeding conditions.

Accordingly, opponent processes between these NAc inputs or cell types may underlie efficient reward seeking. We assess the contributions of these circuit elements to mouse operant behavior during recurring conditions when reward is and is not available. Although direct pathway stimulation is rewarding and indirect pathway stimulation aversive, the activity of both cell types is elevated during periods of behavioral suppression, and the inhibition of either cell-type selectively increases unproductive reward seeking. Amygdala and thalamic inputs are also necessary for behavioral suppression, even though they both support self-stimulation and innervate different NAc subregions. These data suggest that efficient reward seeking relies on complementary activity across NAc cell types and inputs rather than opponent processes between them.",0,0.0,{}

Indeed, ASC released by a pyroptotic cell can be functionally built into the neighboring microglia NOD-like receptor protein (NLRP3) inflammasome. Compared with protein-only application, exposure to ASC-Aβ composites amplifies the proinflammatory response, resulting in pyroptotic cell death, setting free functional ASC and inducing a feedforward stimulating vicious cycle. Clustering around ASC fibrils also compromises clearance of Aβ by microglia.

Specifically, we show that miR-181a promotes DC-SIGN expression during terminal mo-DC differentiation and limits its sensitivity and responsiveness to TLR triggering and CD40 ligation. Mechanistically, miR-181a sustains ERK-MAPK signaling in mo-DCs, thereby enabling the maintenance of high levels of DC-SIGN and a high activation threshold. Low miR-181a levels during mo-DC differentiation, induced by inflammatory signals, do not support the high phospho-ERK signal transduction required for DC-SIGNhi mo-DCs and lead to development of proinflammatory DC-SIGNlo/- mo-DCs.

Distinct from their conventional role in macrophage reprogramming to anti-inflammatory phenotype by a PGE2-dependent mechanism, MSCs enhance the phagocytic activity of macrophages, which partly depends on the uptake of MSC mitochondria-containing extracellular vesicles. The MSC-primed macrophages increase the secretion of amphiregulin (AREG) in a phagocytosis-dependent manner. AREG is essential for MSC-primed macrophages to suppress immune responses through regulatory T (Treg) cells and to protect corneal epithelial stem cells via apoptosis inhibition and proliferation promotion.

Here, we show that in the absence of piRNAs, human PIWIL1 in PDAC functions as an oncoprotein by activating the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) E3 complex, which then targets a critical cell adhesion-related protein, Pinin, to enhance PDAC metastasis. This is in contrast to piRNA-dependent PIWIL1 ubiquitination and removal by APC/C during late spermiogenesis. These findings unveil a piRNA-dependent mechanism to switch PIWIL1 from a substrate in spermatids to a co-activator of APC/C in human cancer cells.",2,1.5,"{""Activation"": 2}"
32203417,"TAZ promotes growth, development and tumorigenesis by regulating the expression of target genes. However, the manner in which TAZ orchestrates the transcriptional responses is poorly defined. Here we demonstrate that TAZ forms nuclear condensates through liquid-liquid phase separation to compartmentalize its DNA-binding cofactor TEAD4, coactivators BRD4 and MED1, and the transcription elongation factor CDK9 for transcription. TAZ forms phase-separated droplets in vitro and liquid-like nuclear condensates in vivo, and this ability is negatively regulated by Hippo signalling through LATS-mediated phosphorylation and is mediated by the coiled-coil (CC) domain. Deletion of the TAZ CC domain or substitution with the YAP CC domain prevents the phase separation of TAZ and its ability to induce the expression of TAZ-specific target genes. Thus, we identify a mechanism of transcriptional activation by TAZ and demonstrate that pathway-specific transcription factors also engage the phase-separation mechanism for efficient and specific transcriptional activation.",2,4.5,"{""Inhibition"": 1, ""Activation"": 1}"

However, it remains largely unknown how mono-ubiquitinated histone H2A on lysine 119 (H2AK119ub1) is established and stably propagated during cell division. In this study, we found that the proteins RYBP and YAF2 each specifically bind H2AK119ub1 to recruit the RYBP-PRC1 or YAF2-PRC1 complex to catalyse the ubiquitination of H2A on neighbouring nucleosomes through a positive-feedback model. Additionally, we demonstrated that histone H1-compacted chromatin enhances the distal propagation of H2AK119ub1, thereby reinforcing the inheritance of H2AK119ub1 during cell division. Moreover, we showed that either disruption of RYBP/YAF2-PRC1 activity or impairment of histone H1-dependent chromatin compaction resulted in a significant defect of the maintenance of H2AK119ub1.

How Rho signalling patterns are established in dynamic cell spaces to control cellular morphogenesis is unclear. Through a family-wide characterization of substrate specificities, interactomes and localization, we reveal at the systems level how RhoGEFs and RhoGAPs contextualize and spatiotemporally control Rho signalling. These proteins are widely autoinhibited to allow local regulation, form complexes to jointly coordinate their networks and provide positional information for signalling. RhoGAPs are more promiscuous than RhoGEFs to confine Rho activity gradients. Our resource enabled us to uncover a multi-RhoGEF complex downstream of G-protein-coupled receptors controlling CDC42-RHOA crosstalk. Moreover, we show that integrin adhesions spatially segregate GEFs and GAPs to shape RAC1 activity zones in response to mechanical cues. This mechanism controls the protrusion and contraction dynamics fundamental to cell motility.

The inflammatory nature of advanced ccRCC was recapitulated in a preclinical model of ccRCC. Amplification of cancer-cell-intrinsic inflammation during ccRCC progression triggered neutrophil-dependent lung metastasis. Massive expression of inflammation-related genes was transcriptionally activated by epigenetic remodelling through mechanisms such as DNA demethylation and super-enhancer formation. A bromodomain and extra-terminal motif inhibitor synchronously suppressed C-X-C-type chemokines in ccRCC cells and decreased neutrophil-dependent lung metastasis.

These colonization-regulating activities involve microbe-microbe and microbe-host interactions, which induce, through utilization of complex bacterial networks, competition over nutrients, inhibition by antimicrobial peptides, stimulation of the host immune system, and promotion of mucus and intestinal epithelial barrier integrity. Distinct virulent pathogens overcome this colonization resistance and host immunity as part of a hostile takeover of the host niche, leading to clinically overt infection. The following review provides a mechanistic overview of the role of commensal microbes in modulating colonization resistance and pathogenic infections and means by which infectious agents may overcome such inhibition.

This metabolism-epigenome link sensitizes chromatin methylation to altered SAM abundance, yet the mechanisms that allow organisms to adapt and protect epigenetic information during life-experienced fluctuations in SAM availability are unknown. We identified a robust response to SAM depletion that is highlighted by preferential cytoplasmic and nuclear mono-methylation of H3 Lys 9 (H3K9) at the expense of broad losses in histone di- and tri-methylation. Under SAM-depleted conditions, H3K9 mono-methylation preserves heterochromatin stability and supports global epigenetic persistence upon metabolic recovery. This unique chromatin response was robust across the mouse lifespan and correlated with improved metabolic health, supporting a significant role for epigenetic adaptation to SAM depletion in vivo.

We present stochastic, first-principle models that are parameterized on a large in vitro dataset and that accurately predict the epidemiological abundance of resistance mutations across multiple leukemia clinical trials. The ability to forecast resistance variants requires an understanding of their underlying mutation biases.

This pathway requires TLR4 engagement with TRIF, but not involvement of TBK1 or IRF3. Exclusive Myd88 activators are unable to trigger G0 arrest or SAMHD1 dephosphorylation, demonstrating this arrest is also Myd88/nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) independent. The G0 arrest is accompanied by p21 upregulation and CDK1 depletion, consistent with the observed SAMHD1 dephosphorylation at T592. Furthermore, we show by SAMHD1 knockdown that the TLR4-activated pathway potently blocks HIV-1 infection in macrophages specifically via SAMHD1.

We found the uptake of diet-supplied vitamin B12 in the intestine to be critical for the expression of a long isoform of PTP-3 (PTP-3A) in neuronal and glial cells. The expression of PTP-3A cell autonomously regulates glial migration and synapse formation through interaction with an extracellular matrix protein NID-1/nidogen 1.

Recently, we showed that these effects are integrated to maintain transcription homeostasis: replicated genes increase in dosage, but their expression remains stable due to replication-dependent epigenetic changes that suppress transcription. Here, we examine whether reduced transcription from replicated DNA results from limited accessibility to regulatory factors by measuring the time-resolved binding of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and specific transcription factors (TFs) to DNA during S phase in budding yeast. We show that the Pol II binding pattern is largely insensitive to DNA dosage, indicating limited binding to replicated DNA. In contrast, binding of three TFs (Reb1, Abf1, and Rap1) to DNA increases with the increasing DNA dosage.

The bacterial pore-forming toxin pneumolysin (PLY), along with the pyruvate oxidase SpxB responsible for H2O2 production, play important roles in the induction of this modification. The combined effects of PLY and H2O2 trigger host signaling that culminates in H3S10 dephosphorylation, which is mediated by the host cell phosphatase PP1. Strikingly, S. pneumoniae infection induces dephosphorylation and subsequent activation of PP1 catalytic activity. Colonization of PP1 catalytically deficient cells results in impaired intracellular S. pneumoniae survival and infection.

Depletion of CD11b+ macrophages in mice (macrophagedep mice) after endotoxin or after Pseudomonas aeruginosa causes expansion of the inflammatory alveolar macrophage population, leading to neutrophil accumulation, irreversible loss of lung vascular barrier function, and lethality.

To elucidate environmental effects on epithelial regenerative outcomes in vitro, here, we isolate and culture a population of pharmacologically expanded basal cells (peBCs) from rat tracheas. At peak basal marker expression, we simultaneously split peBCs into four in vitro platforms: organoid, air-liquid interface (ALI), engineered trachea, and engineered lung. Following differentiation, these samples are evaluated using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and computational pipelines are developed to compare samples both globally and at the population level. A sample of native rat tracheal epithelium is also evaluated by scRNA-seq as a control for engineered epithelium.

Epithelial integrity is dependent on actomyosin bundles at adherens junctions, but the origin of these junctional bundles is incompletely understood. Here we show that peripheral actomyosin bundles can be generated from a specific actin stress fiber subtype, transverse arcs, through their lateral fusion at cell-cell contacts. Importantly, we find that assembly and maintenance of peripheral actomyosin bundles are dependent on the mechanosensitive CaMKK2/AMPK signaling pathway and that inhibition of this route leads to disruption of tension-maintaining actomyosin bundles and re-growth of stress fiber precursors. This results in redistribution of cellular forces, defects in monolayer integrity, and loss of epithelial identity. These data provide evidence that the mechanosensitive CaMKK2/AMPK pathway is critical for the maintenance of peripheral actomyosin bundles and thus dictates cell-cell junctions through cellular force distribution.",0,0.0,{}

To investigate the so far elusive regulatory origin of CL homeostasis in mice, we combine lipidomics, integrative transcriptomics, and data-driven machine learning. We demonstrate that not transcriptional regulation, but cellular phospholipid compositions are closely linked to the tissue specificity of CL patterns allowing artificial neural networks to precisely predict cross-tissue CL compositions in a consistent mechanistic specificity rationale. This is especially relevant for the interpretation of disease-related perturbations of CL homeostasis, by allowing differentiation between specific aberrations in CL metabolism and changes caused by global alterations in cellular (phospho-)lipid metabolism.",2,0.0,"{""Inhibition"": 2}"

For some morphogens, adaptation of the gradients to tissue size allows morphological patterns to remain proportioned as the organs grow. In the zebrafish pectoral fin, we found that BMP signaling forms a two-dimensional gradient. The length of the gradient scales with tissue length and its amplitude increases with fin size according to a power-law. Gradient scaling and amplitude power-laws are signatures of growth control by time derivatives of morphogenetic signaling: cell division correlates with the fold change over time of the cellular signaling levels. We show that Smoc1 regulates BMP gradient scaling and growth in the fin. Smoc1 scales the gradient by means of a feedback loop: Smoc1 is a BMP agonist and BMP signaling represses Smoc1 expression.

Combinatorial binding of transcription factors, cofactors, and chromatin modifiers spatially segregates TAD regions into various finer-scale structures with distinct regulatory features including stripes, dots, and domains linking promoters-to-promoters (P-P) or enhancers-to-promoters (E-P) and bundle contacts between Polycomb regions. E-P stripes extending from the edge of domains predominantly link co-expressed loci, often in the absence of CTCF and cohesin occupancy.

32217664,"Telomeres consist of TTAGGG repeats bound by protein complexes that serve to protect the natural end of linear chromosomes. Most cells maintain telomere repeat lengths by using the enzyme telomerase, although there are some cancer cells that use a telomerase-independent mechanism of telomere extension, termed alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT). Cells that use ALT are characterized, in part, by the presence of specialized PML nuclear bodies called ALT-associated PML bodies (APBs). APBs localize to and cluster telomeric ends together with telomeric and DNA damage factors, which led to the proposal that these bodies act as a platform on which ALT can occur. However, the necessity of APBs and their function in the ALT pathway has remained unclear. Here, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to delete PML and APB components from ALT-positive cells to cleanly define the function of APBs in ALT. We found that PML is required for the ALT mechanism, and that this necessity stems from APBs' role in localizing the BLM-TOP3A-RMI (BTR) complex to ALT telomere ends. Strikingly, recruitment of the BTR complex to telomeres in a PML-independent manner bypasses the need for PML in the ALT pathway, suggesting that BTR localization to telomeres is sufficient to sustain ALT activity.",0,0.0,{}

32217666,"Cell type-specific transcriptional programs that drive differentiation of specialized cell types are key players in development and tissue regeneration. One of the most dramatic changes in the transcription program in Drosophila occurs with the transition from proliferating spermatogonia to differentiating spermatocytes, with >3000 genes either newly expressed or expressed from new alternative promoters in spermatocytes. Here we show that opening of these promoters from their closed state in precursor cells requires function of the spermatocyte-specific tMAC complex, localized at the promoters. The spermatocyte-specific promoters lack the previously identified canonical core promoter elements except for the Inr. Instead, these promoters are enriched for the binding site for the TALE-class homeodomain transcription factors Achi/Vis and for a motif originally identified under tMAC ChIP-seq peaks. The tMAC motif resembles part of the previously identified 14-bp β2UE1 element critical for spermatocyte-specific expression. Analysis of downstream sequences relative to transcription start site usage suggested that ACA and CNAAATT motifs at specific positions can help promote efficient transcription initiation.

To identify genes that act directly in the reproductive system to regulate somatic proteostasis, we performed a tissue targeted genetic screen for germline modifiers of polyglutamine aggregation in muscle cells. We found that inhibiting the formation of the extracellular vitelline layer of the fertilized embryo inside the uterus suppresses aggregation, improves stress resilience in an HSF-1-dependent manner, and restores the heat-shock response in the somatic tissues of the parent. This pathway relies on DAF-16/FOXO activation in vulval tissues to maintain stress resilience in the mother, suggesting that the integrity of the embryo is monitored by the vulva to detect damage and initiate an organismal protective response.

Differential intra- versus inter-SAHD interactions lead to the formation of senescence-associated heterochromatin foci (SAHFs) in OIS but not in RS. This OIS-specific configuration brings active genes located in genomic regions adjacent to SAHDs in close spatial proximity and favors their expression.

As expected, NELF and DSIF increased pausing, and P-TEFb promoted pause release. Unexpectedly, the PIC alone was sufficient to reconstitute pausing, suggesting RNAPII pausing is an inherent PIC function. In agreement, pausing was lost upon replacement of the TFIID complex with TATA-binding protein (TBP), and PRO-seq experiments revealed widespread disruption of RNAPII pausing upon acute depletion (t = 60 min) of TFIID subunits in human or Drosophila cells.

In addition, progesterone bypasses the transcriptional elongation block resulting from Paf complex deficiency, rescuing neural crest defects in ctr9 morphant and paf1(alnz24) mutant embryos. Using proteomics, we found that Pgr binds the RNA helicase protein Ddx21. ddx21-deficient zebrafish show resistance to leflunomide-induced stress. At a molecular level, nucleotide depletion reduced the chromatin occupancy of DDX21 in human A375 melanoma cells.

Here, we report that KDM4A-mediated H3K9me3 demethylation at bdH3K4me3 in oocytes is crucial for normal pre-implantation development and zygotic genome activation after fertilization. The loss of KDM4A in oocytes causes aberrant H3K9me3 spreading over bdH3K4me3, resulting in insufficient transcriptional activation of genes, endogenous retroviral elements and chimeric transcripts initiated from long terminal repeats during zygotic genome activation.

This presents a significant drain on the cellular NADPH pool and renders such cells dependent on the pentose phosphate pathway. Limiting glucose supply to SLC7A11high cancer cells results in marked accumulation of intracellular cystine, redox system collapse and rapid cell death, which can be rescued by treatments that prevent disulfide accumulation. We further show that inhibitors of glucose transporters selectively kill SLC7A11high cancer cells and suppress SLC7A11high tumour growth.

Although strong Ascl1 binding was exclusively associated with bHLH motifs, strong Myod1-binding sites were co-enriched with non-bHLH motifs, possibly explaining why Ascl1 is less context dependent. Finally, we observed that promiscuous binding of Myod1 to neuronal targets results in neuronal reprogramming when the muscle program is inhibited by Myt1l.

We raised rat pups in different spectro-temporal noise statistics during their auditory critical period. As adults, they showed enhanced behavioral performance in detecting vocalizations in noise. Concomitantly, encoding of vocalizations in noise in the primary auditory cortex improves with noise-rearing. Significantly, spectro-temporal modulation plasticity shifts cortical preferences away from the exposed noise statistics, thus reducing noise interference with the foreground sound representation. Auditory cortical plasticity shapes receptive field preferences to optimally extract foreground information in noisy environments during noise-rearing. Early noise exposure induces cortical circuits to implement efficient coding in the joint spectral and temporal modulation domain.",0,0.0,{}
32234480,"Silencing of FMR1 and loss of its gene product, FMRP, results in fragile X syndrome (FXS). FMRP binds brain mRNAs and inhibits polypeptide elongation. Using ribosome profiling of the hippocampus, we find that ribosome footprint levels in Fmr1-deficient tissue mostly reflect changes in RNA abundance. Profiling over a time course of ribosome runoff in wild-type tissue reveals a wide range of ribosome translocation rates; on many mRNAs, the ribosomes are stalled. Sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation of hippocampal slices after ribosome runoff reveals that FMRP co-sediments with stalled ribosomes, and its loss results in decline of ribosome stalling on specific mRNAs. One such mRNA encodes SETD2, a lysine methyltransferase that catalyzes H3K36me3. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) demonstrates that loss of FMRP alters the deployment of this histone mark. H3K36me3 is associated with alternative pre-RNA processing, which we find occurs in an FMRP-dependent manner on transcripts linked to neural function and autism spectrum disorders.",1,1.5,"{""Inhibition"": 1}"

Morphological analyses of NvPOU4 mutants crossed to transgenic reporter lines show that the loss of NvPOU4 does not affect the initial specification of neural cells. Transcriptomes derived from the mutants and from different neural cell populations reveal that NvPOU4 is required for the execution of the terminal differentiation program of these neural cells.

Following that, NSCs have a major switch in their progenitor properties and produce γ-aminobutyric acid (GABAergic) interneurons for the olfactory bulb (OB), cortical oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes. Herein, we provide evidence for the molecular mechanism that underlies this switch in the state of neocortical NSCs. We show that, at around E16.5, mouse neocortical NSCs start to generate GSX2-expressing (GSX2+) intermediate progenitor cells (IPCs). In vivo lineage-tracing study revealed that GSX2+ IPC population gives rise not only to OB interneurons but also to cortical oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, suggesting that they are a tri-potential population.

Nerve terminal availability of TRPM8 determines cold sensitivity, but how axonal secretory organelles control channel delivery remains poorly understood. Here we examine the distribution of TRPM8 and trafficking organelles in cold-sensitive peripheral axons and disrupt trafficking by targeting the ARF-GEF GBF1 pharmacologically or the small GTPase RAB6 by optogenetics. In axons of the sciatic nerve, inhibition of GBF1 interrupts TRPM8 trafficking and increases association with the trans-Golgi network, LAMP1, and Golgi satellites, which distribute profusely along the axonal shaft. Accordingly, both TRPM8-dependent ongoing activity and cold-evoked responses reversibly decline upon GBF1 inhibition in nerve endings of corneal cold thermoreceptors. Inhibition of RAB6, which also associates to Golgi satellites, decreases cold-induced responses in vivo.

These viruses can be reactivated by latency reversal agents. We find that syncytin, the envelope glycoprotein of human endogenous retrovirus family W1 expressed on placental trophoblasts, triggers cell fusion with HIV-infected T cells. This results in cell-to-cell spread of HIV to placental trophoblasts. Such cell-to-cell spread of HIV is less sensitive to ART than free virus. Replication in syncytin-expressing cells can also produce syncytin-pseudotyped HIV, further expanding its ability to infect non-CD4 cells.

Cdk1 phosphorylates many proteins involved in epigenetic regulation, including writers and erasers of all major histone marks. Consistent with these findings, inhibition of Cdk1 altered histone-modification status of ESCs. High levels of Cdk1 in ESCs phosphorylate and partially inactivate Dot1l, the H3K79 methyltransferase responsible for placing activating marks on gene bodies.

Here, we examine whether plasma cell development is also associated with changes in nuclear architecture. We find that the onset of plasma cell development is concomitant with a decline in remote genomic interactions; a gain in euchromatic character at loci encoding for factors that specify plasma cell fate, including Prdm1 and Atf4; and establishment of de novo inter-chromosomal hubs. We find that, in developing plasma cells and concurrent with transcriptional silencing, the Ebf1 locus repositions from an euchromatic to peri-centromeric heterochromatic environment. Finally, we find that inter-chromosomal hubs are enriched for the deposition of either H3K27Ac or H3K27me3. These data indicate that plasma cell fate is orchestrated by elaborate changes in genome topology and that epigenetic marks, linked with super-enhancers or transcriptionally repressed regions, are enriched at inter-chromosomal hubs.",0,0.0,{}
32268090,"Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) is a critical component of host innate immune defense but can contribute to chronic autoimmune or autoinflammatory disease. Once activated, the cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP)-adenosine monophosphate (AMP) (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS)-STING pathway induces both type I interferon (IFN) expression and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)-mediated cytokine production. Currently, these two signaling arms are thought to be mediated by a single upstream kinase, TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1). Here, using genetic and pharmacological approaches, we show that TBK1 alone is dispensable for STING-induced NF-κB responses in human and mouse immune cells, as well as in vivo. We further demonstrate that TBK1 acts redundantly with IκB kinase ε (IKKε) to drive NF-κB upon STING activation. Interestingly, we show that activation of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) is highly dependent on TBK1 kinase activity, whereas NF-κB is significantly less sensitive to TBK1/IKKε kinase inhibition. Our work redefines signaling events downstream of cGAS-STING.

However, many pathogens have evolved strategies to evade inflammasome activation. Here we describe an alternative, two-cell model for IL-1β release where invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells use the death receptor pathway to instruct antigen-presenting cells to secrete IL-1β. Following cognate interactions with TLR-primed bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs), iNKT cells rapidly translocate intracellular Fas ligand to the surface to engage Fas on BMDCs. Fas ligation activates a caspase-8-dependent signaling cascade in BMDCs that drives IL-1β release largely independent of inflammasomes. The apoptotic program initiated by Fas ligation rapidly transitions into a pyroptosis-like form of cell death mediated by gasdermin D. Together, our findings support a two-cell model for IL-1β secretion that may supersede inflammasome activation when cytosolic triggers fail.",1,0.0,"{""Activation"": 1}"

In order to identify therapeutically targetable dependencies within this disease context, we performed an RNAi screen targeting epigenetic/chromatin-associated genes in patient-derived DMG cultures. This identified AFF4, the scaffold protein of the super elongation complex (SEC), as a molecular dependency in DMG. Interrogation of SEC function demonstrates a key role for maintaining clonogenic potential while promoting self-renewal of tumor stem cells. Small-molecule inhibition of SEC using clinically relevant CDK9 inhibitors restores regulatory RNA polymerase II pausing, promotes cellular differentiation, and leads to potent anti-tumor effect both in vitro and in patient-derived xenograft models.

Furthermore, genome-wide open chromatin profiling using equivalent developmental stages of mouse and pig limb buds reveals the functional divergence of about one-third of the regulatory genome.

Mature LysoDCs but not macrophages express a gene set in common with conventional dendritic cells and prime naive helper T cells in vitro.

We identify a dopamine/cyclic AMP (cAMP)/CREB axis acting within sweet taste neurons that controls taste perception but is largely dispensable for acute taste transduction. This pathway modulates sweet taste perception in response to both sensory- and nutrient-restricted diets and converges on PGC1α, a critical regulator of metabolic health and lifespan.

Nodal and BMP signal non-cell-autonomously and form similar protein gradients in this context, but the signaling range of Nodal (pSmad2) is shorter than the BMP range (pSmad5). This yields a localized region of pSmad2 activity around the Nodal source, overlapping with a broad domain of pSmad5 activity across the embryo. Cell fates induced in various regions stereotypically correlate with pSmad2-to-pSmad5 ratios and can even be induced BMP- and Nodal-independently with different ratios of constitutively active Smad2 and Smad5.

This switches the proteostasis strategy in neural progeny cells to promote sequestration of misfolded proteins into protective inclusions. The chaperone network of NSPCs is more effective than that of differentiated cells, leading to improved management of proteotoxic stress and amyloidogenic proteins.

However, upon glutamate treatment, aggregates form in neurons but not in patient-derived neural progenitors. During differentiation, the chaperone network is drastically rewired, including loss of expression of the anti-amyloidogenic chaperone DNAJB6. Upregulation of DNAJB6 in neurons antagonizes glutamate-induced aggregation, while knockdown of DNAJB6 in progenitors results in spontaneous polyglutamine aggregation.

Here we show that loss of REDD1, a stress-induced metabolic regulator, is sufficient to reprogram lipid metabolism and drive progression of RAS mutant cancers. Redd1 deletion in genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of KRAS-dependent pancreatic and lung adenocarcinomas converts preneoplastic lesions into invasive and metastatic carcinomas. Metabolic profiling reveals that REDD1-deficient/RAS mutant cells exhibit enhanced uptake of lysophospholipids and lipid storage, coupled to augmented fatty acid oxidation that sustains both ATP levels and ROS-detoxifying NADPH. Mechanistically, REDD1 loss triggers HIF-dependent activation of a lipid storage pathway involving PPARγ and the prometastatic factor CD36. Correspondingly, decreased REDD1 expression and a signature of REDD1 loss predict poor outcomes selectively in RAS mutant but not RAS wild-type human lung and pancreas carcinomas. Collectively, our findings reveal the REDD1-mediated stress response as a novel tumor suppressor whose loss defines a RAS mutant tumor subset characterized by reprogramming of lipid metabolism, invasive and metastatic progression, and poor prognosis.

To characterize the spatial arrangement of Sin3 subunits, we combined Halo affinity capture, chemical crosslinking, and high-resolution mass spectrometry (XL-MS) to determine intersubunit distance constraints, identifying 66 interprotein and 63 self-crosslinks for 13 Sin3 subunits. Having assessed crosslink authenticity by mapping self-crosslinks onto existing structures, we used distance restraints from interprotein crosslinks to guide assembly of a Sin3 complex substructure. We identified the relative positions of subunits SAP30L, HDAC1, SUDS3, HDAC2, and ING1 around the SIN3A scaffold.

Unexpectedly, in mice we found no ambient temperature zone where both metabolic rate and body temperature were constant. Body temperature began increasing once cold-induced thermogenesis was no longer required.

During the resting-light phase, the energy expenditure minimum spanned ∼4°C of ambient temperature, whereas in the active-dark phase it approximated a point. We propose the concept of a thermoneutral point (TNP), a discrete ambient temperature below which energy expenditure increases and above which body temperature increases. Humans do not have a TNP. As studied, the mouse TNP is ∼29°C in light phase and ∼33°C in dark phase.

These neurological complications present major clinical challenges, yet their underlying mechanisms and causal relationships to disease progression are poorly characterized. Here, we follow glioma progression in awake Thy1-GCaMP6f mice using in vivo wide-field optical mapping to monitor alterations in both neuronal activity and functional hemodynamics. The bilateral synchrony of spontaneous neuronal activity gradually decreases in glioma-infiltrated cortical regions, while neurovascular coupling becomes progressively disrupted compared to uninvolved cortex. Over time, mice develop diverse patterns of high amplitude discharges and eventually generalized seizures that appear to originate at the tumors' infiltrative margins. Interictal and seizure events exhibit positive neurovascular coupling in uninfiltrated cortex; however, glioma-infiltrated regions exhibit disrupted hemodynamic responses driving seizure-evoked hypoxia.

32294437,"B cell receptor (BCR) engagement induces naive B cells to differentiate and perform critical immune-regulatory functions. Acquisition of functional specificity requires that a cell survive, enter the cell cycle, and proliferate. We establish that quantitatively distinct Ca2+ signals triggered by variations in the extent of BCR engagement dynamically regulate these transitions by controlling nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), NFAT, and mTORC1 activity. Weak BCR engagement induces apoptosis by failing to activate NF-κB-driven anti-apoptotic gene expression. Stronger signals that trigger more robust Ca2+ signals promote NF-κB-dependent survival and NFAT-, mTORC1-, and c-Myc-dependent cell-cycle entry and proliferation. Finally, we establish that CD40 or TLR9 costimulation circumvents these Ca2+-regulated checkpoints of B cell activation and proliferation.

Silencing of PGAM1 expression in glioma cells consequently decreases formation of γ-H2AX foci, increases apoptosis, and decreases clonogenicity following irradiation (IR) and temozolomide (TMZ) treatment. Furthermore, mice intracranially implanted with PGAM1-knockdown cells have significantly improved survival after treatment with IR and TMZ.

We show that the scaffolding protein Scribble associates with cGMP-synthesizing enzymes soluble-guanylate-cyclase (sGC) and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). The Scribble scaffold is preferentially localized to and mediates cGMP increase in dendrites. These events are regulated by kinesin KifC2. Knockdown of Scribble, sGC-β1, or KifC2 or disrupting their associations prevents cGMP increase in dendrites and causes severe defects in apical dendrite development. Local cGMP elevation or sGC expression rescues the effects of Scribble knockdown on dendrite development, indicating that Scribble is an upstream regulator of cGMP.

To address this question, we dynamically record EC movements and use 3D quantitative methods to segregate the contributions of various cellular processes to the cellular trajectories in the zebrafish dorsal aorta. We find that ECs spread toward the cell extrusion area following the tissue deformation direction dictated by flow-derived mechanical forces. Cell extrusion increases when blood flow is impaired. Similarly, the mechanosensor polycystic kidney disease 2 (pkd2) limits cell extrusion, suggesting that ECs actively sense mechanical forces in the process. These findings identify pkd2 and flow as critical regulators of EC extrusion and suggest that mechanical forces coordinate this process by maintaining ECs within the endothelium.",0,0.0,{}

In preliminary results from one of two cohorts of humanized mice infected with HIV-1 for 6 weeks, CD47 blockade reduces plasma p24 levels and restores CD4+ T cell counts.

We demonstrate that Gr21a is required for CO2 responses in Drosophila, as has been shown for Gr63a. Next, we generate a Drosophila double mutant for Gr21a and Gr63a, and in this background, we functionally express combinations of Aedes Gr1, Gr2, and Gr3 genes in the CO2 empty neuron. Only two subunits, Gr2 and Gr3, suffice for response to CO2. Addition of Gr1 increases sensitivity to CO2, whereas it decreases the response to pyridine. The inhibitory effect of the antagonist isobutyric acid is observed upon addition of Gr1.

In addition, we show that the standard genetic code couples this structural correlation into a tight evolutionary relationship. We illustrate the extent of this evolutionary entanglement of amyloid propensity and globular protein stability. Suppressing a 600-Ma-conserved amyloidogenic segment in the p53 core domain fold is structurally feasible but requires 7-bp substitutions to concomitantly introduce two aggregation-suppressing and three stabilizing amino acid mutations.

We find that the external germinal layer (EGL) is derived from embryonic Sox2+ precursors and that the EGL maintains a rare fraction of Sox2+ cells during the first postnatal week. Through lineage tracing and single-cell analysis, we demonstrate that these Sox2+ cells are within the Atoh1+ lineage, contribute extensively to adult granule neurons, and resemble Sox2+ tumor cells. Critically, constitutive activation of the SHH pathway leads to their aberrant persistence in the EGL and rapid tumor onset.

Adult Sertoli cells are polarized so that they can simultaneously support earlier-stage spermatogenic cells (e.g., spermatogonia) basally and later-stage cells (e.g., spermatids) apically. To test the consequences of disrupting cell polarity in Sertoli cells, we perform a Sertoli-specific conditional deletion of Rac1, which encodes a Rho GTPase required for apicobasal cell polarity. Rac1 conditional knockout adults exhibit spermatogenic arrest at the round spermatid stage, with severe disruption of Sertoli cell polarity, and show increased germline and Sertoli cell apoptosis. Thus, Sertoli Rac1 function is critical for the progression of spermatogenesis but, surprisingly, is dispensable for fetal testicular development, adult maintenance of undifferentiated spermatogonia, and meiotic entry.

32294471,"Gene expression is regulated by the rates of synthesis and degradation of mRNAs, but how these processes are coordinated is poorly understood.

These effects are also exerted by internal ribosome entry site (IRES) elements, which we found to be transcriptional pause sites. However, when transcription dynamics, and subsequently poly(A) tails, are globally altered, cells buffer mRNA levels by adjusting the expression of mRNA degradation machinery. Stress-provoked global impediment of transcription elongation leads to a dramatic inhibition of the mRNA degradation machinery and massive mRNA stabilization. Accordingly, globally enhanced transcription, such as following B cell activation or glucose stimulation, has the opposite effects.

32299913,"SHC adaptor protein (SHCA) and lipoma-preferred partner (LPP) mediate transforming growth factor β (TGFβ)-induced breast cancer cell migration and invasion. Reduced expression of either protein diminishes breast cancer lung metastasis, but the reason for this effect is unclear. Here, using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, we found that TGFβ enhanced the assembly and disassembly rates of paxillin-containing adhesions in an SHCA-dependent manner through the phosphorylation of the specific SHCA tyrosine residues Tyr-239, Tyr-240, and Tyr-313. Using a BioID proximity labeling approach, we show that SHCA exists in a complex with a variety of actin cytoskeletal proteins, including paxillin and LPP. Consistent with a functional interaction between SHCA and LPP, TGFβ-induced LPP localization to cellular adhesions depended on SHCA. Once localized to the adhesions, LPP was required for TGFβ-induced increases in cell migration and adhesion dynamics. Mutations that impaired LPP localization to adhesions (mLIM1) or impeded interactions with the actin cytoskeleton via α-actinin (ΔABD) abrogated migratory responses to TGFβ. Live-cell TIRF microscopy revealed that SHCA clustering at the cell membrane preceded LPP recruitment. We therefore hypothesize that, in the presence of TGFβ, SHCA promotes the formation of small, dynamic adhesions by acting as a nucleator of focal complex formation. Finally, we defined a previously unknown function for SHCA in the formation of invadopodia, a process that also required LPP.

Although mir-451 is fully dependent on Drosha/DGCR8, its short stem and small terminal loop render it an intrinsically weak Microprocessor substrate. Thus, it must reside within a cluster for normal biogenesis, although the identity and orientation of its neighbor are flexible. We use DGCR8 tethering assays and operon structure-function assays to demonstrate that local recruitment and transfer of Microprocessor enhances suboptimal substrate processing. This principle applies more broadly since genomic analysis indicates suboptimal canonical miRNAs are enriched in operons, and we validate several of these experimentally.

Multicycle replication of H3N2 IAV and IBV in AECIIs of Tmprss2/Tmprss4-deficient mice varied in sensitivity to protease inhibitors, indicating that different, but overlapping, sets of murine proteases facilitate H3 and IBV HA cleavages.

Its biogenesis requires the assembly and integration of distinct intermediate modules, mediated by numerous assembly factors. The mitochondrial complex I intermediate assembly (MCIA) complex, containing assembly factors NDUFAF1, ECSIT, ACAD9, and TMEM126B, is required for building the intermediate ND2-module. The role of the MCIA complex and the involvement of other proteins in the biogenesis of this module is unclear. Cell knockout studies reveal that while each MCIA component is critical for complex I assembly, a hierarchy of stability exists centered on ACAD9. We also identify TMEM186 and COA1 as bona fide components of the MCIA complex with loss of either resulting in MCIA complex defects and reduced complex I assembly. TMEM186 enriches with newly translated ND3, and COA1 enriches with ND2. Our findings provide new functional insights into the essential nature of the MCIA complex in complex I assembly.",0,0.0,{}

Its activity as an energy metabolism regulator has important implications in cancer, neurodegeneration, and ischemia. Selective inhibitors of TRAP1 could inform on its mechanisms of action and set the stage for targeted drug development, but their identification was hampered by the similarity among active sites in HSP90 homologs. We use a dynamics-based approach to identify a TRAP1 allosteric pocket distal to its active site that can host drug-like molecules, and we select small molecules with optimal stereochemical features to target the pocket. These leads inhibit TRAP1, but not HSP90, ATPase activity and revert TRAP1-dependent downregulation of succinate dehydrogenase activity in cancer cells and in zebrafish larvae.

ULK1-dependent phosphorylation of RIPK1 reduces complex IIb/necrosome assembly and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced cell death, whereas deprivation of ULK1 enhances TNF-induced cell death. We observe that ULK1 phosphorylates multiple sites of RIPK1, but it appears that especially phosphorylation of S357 within the intermediate domain of RIPK1 mediates this cell-death-inhibiting effect.

Importin-α3-deficient mice show reduced NF-κB-activated antiviral gene expression and increased influenza lethality. Thus, importin-α3 plays a key role in antiviral immunity against influenza.

These events arise when cancer cells initiate without ultimately ending the program of drug-stimulated death.

SAUR19 subfamily genes have asymmetric expression in Arabidopsis hypocotyls during gravitropic and phototropic responses, induced by the lateral redistribution of auxin. Both the mutation of SAUR19 subfamily genes and the ectopic expression of SAUR19 weaken these tropic responses, indicating the critical role of their asymmetric expression. The auxin-responsive transcription factor ARF7 may directly bind the SAUR19 promoter and activate SAUR19 expression asymmetrically in tropic responses.

These IL-33-responsive microglia (IL-33RMs) express a distinct transcriptome signature that is highlighted by increased major histocompatibility complex class II genes and restored homeostatic signature genes. IL-33-induced remodeling of chromatin accessibility and PU.1 transcription factor binding at the signature genes of IL-33RM control their transcriptome reprogramming.

Wdr47 deficiency represses the multipolar-bipolar transition of cortical neurons, reduces neurite tip-directed microtubule dynamics, and causes multi-axon formation. Overexpression of Wdr47 in wild-type neurons inhibits axon specification and neutralizes Taxol-induced neurite overgrowth and axon overproduction. Wdr47 interacts with the Camsap family of microtubule minus-end-binding proteins; associates with microtubules through Camsap3, whose gene disruption also causes multi-axons; and promotes Camsap3 accumulation in neurites of unpolarized neurons.

Targeting βcat-GOF to zona Glomerulosa (zG) cells leads to a progressive hyperplastic expansion in the absence of increased proliferation. Instead, we find that hyperplasia results from a functional block in the ability of zG cells to transdifferentiate into zona Fasciculata (zF) cells. Mechanistically, zG cells demonstrate an upregulation of Pde2a, an inhibitor of zF-specific cAMP/PKA signaling.

The covalent modification prevents the transfer of ubiquitin from ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 to ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2, which inhibits subsequent ubiquitin activation by E2 and E3 enzymes in the ubiquitination cascade and leads to the shutdown of polyubiquitin synthesis in host cells. This unique modification also causes dysfunction of polyubiquitin chains in cells, thereby blocking host ubiquitin signaling.

Free MIM complexes insert single-spanning proteins that are imported in a Tom70-independent manner. Finally, coupling of MIM and SAM promotes early assembly steps of TOM subunits. We conclude that the MIM complex is a major and versatile protein translocase of the mitochondrial outer membrane.",0,0.0,{}

Employing multiple transgenic mouse models of breast cancer, we report that ablation of Rheb1 significantly impedes mammary tumorigenesis. In the absence of Rheb1, a block in tumor initiation can be overcome by multiple independent mutations in Mtor to allow Rheb1-independent reactivation of mTORC1.

It remains unknown how microglia follow an axon-specific distribution pattern to maintain neural circuits. Here, we investigated the mechanisms of microglial accumulation along subcerebral projection axons that were necessary for microglial accumulation in the internal capsule. Screening of molecules involved in this accumulation of microglia to axons of layer V cortical neurons identified netrin-G1, a member of the netrin family of axon guidance molecules with a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol anchor. Deletion or knockdown of the netrin-G1 gene Ntng1 reduced microglial accumulation and caused loss of cortical neurons. Netrin-G1 ligand-Ngl1 knockout-mice-derived microglia showed reduced accumulation along the axons compared with wild-type microglia.

For ZIKV, although there are already 180 copies of Fab at pH 8.0, virus structural changes at pH 5.0 are not inhibited. The immunoglobulin G (IgG):DENV structure at pH 8.0 shows both Fab arms bind to epitopes around the 2-fold vertex. On ZIKV, an additional Fab around the 5-fold vertex at pH 8.0 suggests one IgG arm would engage with an epitope, although the other may bind to other viruses, causing aggregation. For DENV2 at pH 5.0, a similar scenario would occur, suggesting DENV2:IgG complex would aggregate in the endosome.

Here, we find that a range of novel experiences preferentially activates granule cells of the suprapyramidal blade relative to the infrapyramidal blade. Motivated by this, we identify a suprapyramidal-blade-enriched population of granule cells with distinct spatial, morphological, physiological, and developmental properties. Via transcriptomics, we map these traits onto a sparse and discrete granule cell subtype that is recruited at a 10-fold greater frequency than expected by subtype prevalence, constituting the majority of all recruited granule cells.

This reveals how the outer kinetochore has a high nematic order and is largely invariant to the loss of attachment or tension, except for two mechanical sensors. First, Knl1 unravels to relay tension, and second, NDC80 undergoes jackknifing and loss of nematic order under microtubule detachment, with only the latter wired up to the checkpoint signaling system.

Drug-induced inhibition of tumor VEGFR2 interferes with the formation of the EphA2/VEGFR2 heterocomplex, thereby allowing RSK to interact with Serine 897 of EphA2. Inhibition of RSK decreases phosphorylation of Serine 897 EphA2. Selective genetic modeling of Serine 897 of EphA2 or inhibition of EphA2 abrogates the formation of metastases in vivo upon VEGFR2 inhibition. In summary, these findings demonstrate that VEGFR2-targeted therapy conditions VEGFR2-positive NSCLC to Serine 897 EphA2-dependent aggressive tumor growth and metastasis.

Knockdown of ADAR1 in KSHV latently infected cells inhibits viral gene transcription and viral replication during KSHV lytic reactivation. ADAR1 deficiency also significantly increases type I interferon production during KSHV reactivation. This increased interferon response is dependent on activation of the RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) pathway. Depletion of ADAR1 together with either RIG-I, MDA5, or MAVS reverses the increased IFNβ production and rescues KSHV lytic replication.

We show that suboptimal codon pairs cause attenuation, whereas the increase of CpG dinucleotides has no effect. Furthermore, we show that suboptimal codon pairs reduce both mRNA stability and translation efficiency of codon pair-deoptimized genes.

Pathogenic variants in the essential gene BRCA2/FANCD1, when monoallelic, predispose to breast and ovarian cancer, and when biallelic, result in a severe subtype of Fanconi anemia. BRCA2 function in the FA pathway is attributed to its role as a mediator of the RAD51 recombinase in HR repair of programmed DNA double-strand breaks (DSB). BRCA2 and RAD51 functions are also required to protect stalled replication forks from nucleolytic degradation during response to hydroxyurea (HU). While RAD51 has been shown to be necessary in the early steps of ICL repair to prevent aberrant nuclease resection, the role of BRCA2 in this process has not been described. Here, based on the analysis of BRCA2 DNA-binding domain (DBD) mutants (c.8488-1G>A and c.8524C>T) discovered in FA patients presenting with atypical FA-like phenotypes, we establish that BRCA2 is necessary for the protection of DNA at ICLs. Cells carrying BRCA2 DBD mutations are sensitive to ICL-inducing agents but resistant to HU treatment consistent with relatively high HR repair in these cells. BRCA2 function at an ICL protects against DNA2-WRN nuclease-helicase complex and not the MRE11 nuclease that is implicated in the resection of HU-induced stalled replication forks. Our results also indicate that unlike the processing at HU-induced stalled forks, the function of the SNF2 translocases (SMARCAL1, ZRANB3, or HLTF), implicated in fork reversal, are not an integral component of the ICL repair, pointing to a different mechanism of fork protection at different DNA lesions.",1,0.0,"{""Complex"": 1}"

We then applied them in conjunction with functional assays to track the dynamic changes of immunophenotypically purified HSCs in irradiated recipients within the first week after transplantation. Based on our transcriptional classifications, most homed HSCs in bone marrow and spleen became multipotent progenitors and, occasionally, some HSCs gave rise to megakaryocytic-erythroid or myeloid precursors. Parallel in vitro and in vivo functional experiments supported the paradigm of robust differentiation without substantial HSC expansion during the first week.

FBP1 is universally silenced in both human and murine liver tumours. Hepatocyte-specific Fbp1 deletion results in steatosis, concomitant with activation and senescence of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), exhibiting a senescence-associated secretory phenotype. Depleting senescent HSCs by 'senolytic' treatment with dasatinib/quercetin or ABT-263 inhibits tumour progression. We further demonstrate that FBP1-deficient hepatocytes promote HSC activation by releasing HMGB1; blocking its release with the small molecule inflachromene limits FBP1-dependent HSC activation, the subsequent development of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype and tumour progression. Collectively, these findings provide genetic evidence for FBP1 as a metabolic tumour suppressor in liver cancer and establish a critical crosstalk between hepatocyte metabolism and HSC senescence that promotes tumour growth.",3,6.0,"{""Inhibition"": 2, ""Activation"": 1}"

We find that mitochondria in retinas adapt to their hypoxic environment by reversing the succinate dehydrogenase reaction to use fumarate to accept electrons instead of O2. Reverse succinate dehydrogenase activity produces succinate and is enhanced by hypoxia-induced downregulation of cytochrome oxidase. Retinas can export the succinate they produce to the neighboring O2-rich retinal pigment epithelium-choroid complex. There, succinate enhances O2 consumption by severalfold. Malate made from succinate in the pigment epithelium can then be imported into the retina, where it is converted to fumarate to again accept electrons in the reverse succinate dehydrogenase reaction. This malate-succinate shuttle can sustain these two tissues by transferring reducing power from an O2-poor tissue (retina) to an O2-rich one (retinal pigment epithelium-choroid).",2,0.0,"{""Inhibition"": 2}"

Eighty percent of organoids from intrapulmonary lesions have a normal copy number profile, suggesting overgrowth by normal airway organoids (AOs). This is further supported by the failure to detect mutations found in the original tumor in organoids. Histomorphology alone is insufficient to determine tumor purity, but when combined with p63 immunostaining, tumor and normal AOs can be distinguished. Taking into account overgrowth by normal AOs, the establishment rate of pure NSCLC organoids is 17%.

Here, we show unique patterns of lamination and neuronal migration in the developing reptilian cortex. While the multipolar-to-bipolar transition of migrating neurons is essential for mammalian cortical development, the reptilian cortex lacks bipolar-shaped migrating neurons, resulting in an outside-in pattern of cortical development. Furthermore, dynamic regulation of Wnt signal strengths contributes to neuronal morphological changes, which is conserved across species.

At low concentrations, nucleosomes induce cytokines, but high concentrations kill cells before cytokines are produced. The synergy between histones and DNA is critical for sub-lethal signaling and relies on distinct roles for histones and DNA. Histones bind and activate TLR4, whereas DNA recruits TLR4 to histone-containing endosomes. Citrullination is dispensable for NETosis but potentiates histone-mediated signaling. Consistently, chromatin blockade or PAD4 deficiency reduces atherosclerosis. Inflammation is also reduced in infected mice expressing GFP-tagged histones that block TLR4 binding.

Center, but not surround, activation induces direction-selective responses in SACs. Nevertheless, both SAC center and surround elicited direction-selective responses in DSGCs, but to opposite directions.

We find a strong preference for heterodimerization in a number of cases, including mGluR2 with mGluR3, which we confirm in frontal cortex using in situ RNA hybridization and co-immunoprecipitation. Together, our findings support the biological relevance of mGluR heterodimerization and highlight the complex landscape of mGluR populations in the brain.",0,0.0,{}

Here, we show that Glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase 2 (GDE2) signaling underlies a neuronal pathway that promotes oligodendrocyte maturation through the release of soluble neuronally derived factors. Mice lacking global or neuronal GDE2 expression have reduced mature oligodendrocytes and myelin proteins but retain normal numbers of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). Wild-type (WT) OPCs cultured in conditioned medium (CM) from Gde2-null (Gde2KO) neurons exhibit delayed maturation, recapitulating in vivo phenotypes. Gde2KO neurons show robust reduction in canonical Wnt signaling, and genetic activation of Wnt signaling in Gde2KO neurons rescues in vivo and in vitro oligodendrocyte maturation. Phosphacan, a known stimulant of oligodendrocyte maturation, is reduced in CM from Gde2KO neurons but is restored when Wnt signaling is activated.

We developed viral cross-linking and solid-phase purification (VIR-CLASP) to characterize the earliest interactions between viral RNA and cellular proteins. We investigated the infection of human cells using Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and influenza A virus and identified hundreds of direct RNA-protein interactions. Here, we explore the biological impact of three protein classes that bind CHIKV RNA within minutes of infection. We find CHIKV RNA binds and hijacks the lipid-modifying enzyme fatty acid synthase (FASN) for pro-viral activity. We show that CHIKV genomes are N6-methyladenosine modified, and YTHDF1 binds and suppresses CHIKV replication.

32381510,"Collagen is a structural protein whose internal cross-linking critically determines the properties and functions of connective tissue. Knowing how the cross-linking of collagen changes with age is key to understanding why the mechanical properties of tissues change over a lifetime. The current scientific consensus is that collagen cross-linking increases with age and that this increase leads to tendon stiffening. Here, we show that this view should be reconsidered. Using MS-based analyses, we demonstrated that during aging of healthy C57BL/6 mice, the overall levels of collagen cross-linking in tail tendon decreased with age. However, the levels of lysine glycation in collagen, which is not considered a cross-link, increased dramatically with age. We found that in 16-week-old diabetic db/db mice, glycation reaches levels similar to those observed in 98-week-old C57BL/6 mice, while the other cross-links typical of tendon collagen either decreased or remained the same as those observed in 20-week-old WT mice. These results, combined with findings from mechanical testing of tendons from these mice, indicate that overall collagen cross-linking in mouse tendon decreases with age. Our findings also reveal that lysine glycation appears to be an important factor that contributes to tendon stiffening with age and in diabetes.",0,0.0,{}

32381627,"Dysregulation of the DNA/RNA-binding protein FUS causes certain subtypes of ALS/FTD by largely unknown mechanisms. Recent evidence has shown that FUS toxic gain of function due either to mutations or to increased expression can disrupt critical cellular processes, including mitochondrial functions. Here, we demonstrate that in human cells overexpressing wild-type FUS or expressing mutant derivatives, the protein associates with multiple mRNAs, and these are enriched in mRNAs encoding mitochondrial respiratory chain components. Notably, this sequestration leads to reduced levels of the encoded proteins, which is sufficient to bring about disorganized mitochondrial networks, reduced aerobic respiration and increased reactive oxygen species. We further show that mutant FUS associates with mitochondria and with mRNAs encoded by the mitochondrial genome. Importantly, similar results were also observed in fibroblasts derived from ALS patients with FUS mutations. Finally, we demonstrate that FUS loss of function does not underlie the observed mitochondrial dysfunction, and also provides a mechanism for the preferential sequestration of the respiratory chain complex mRNAs by FUS that does not involve sequence-specific binding. Together, our data reveal that respiratory chain complex mRNA sequestration underlies the mitochondrial defects characteristic of ALS/FTD and contributes to the FUS toxic gain of function linked to this disease spectrum.",1,3.0,"{""Activation"": 1}"

In the absence of p53, Gdown1-deficient hepatocytes show a severe dysregulation of cell cycle progression, with incomplete mitoses, and a premalignant-like transformation. Mechanistically, Gdown1 is associated with elongating Pol II on the highly expressed genes and its ablation leads to reduced Pol II recruitment to these genes, suggesting that Pol II redistribution may facilitate hepatocyte re-entry into the cell cycle.

Here, we find that large (>7.3 kb) DNA methylation nadirs (termed ""grand canyons"") can form long loops connecting anchor loci that may be dozens of megabases (Mb) apart, as well as inter-chromosomal links. The interacting loci cover a total of ∼3.5 Mb of the human genome. The strongest interactions are associated with repressive marks made by the Polycomb complex and are diminished upon EZH2 inhibitor treatment. The data are suggestive of the formation of these loops by interactions between repressive elements in the loci, forming a genomic subcompartment, rather than by cohesion/CTCF-mediated extrusion. Interestingly, unlike previously characterized subcompartments, these interactions are present only in particular cell types, such as stem and progenitor cells.

In mammals, paternal chromatin is extensively reprogrammed through the global erasure of DNA methylation and the exchange of histones with protamines1,2. Precisely how the paternal epigenome is reprogrammed in flowering plants has remained unclear since DNA is not demethylated and histones are retained in sperm3,4. Here, we describe a multi-layered mechanism by which H3K27me3 is globally lost from histone-based sperm chromatin in Arabidopsis. This mechanism involves the silencing of H3K27me3 writers, activity of H3K27me3 erasers and deposition of a sperm-specific histone, H3.10 (ref. 5), which we show is immune to lysine 27 methylation. The loss of H3K27me3 facilitates the transcription of genes essential for spermatogenesis and pre-configures sperm with a chromatin state that forecasts gene expression in the next generation.

ZBTB7A/B in turn facilitate the opening of naive pluripotent chromatin loci and the activation of nearby genes. Mechanistically, ZBTB7A not only binds to chromatin loci near to the genes that are activated, but also strategically occupies those that are silenced, consistent with a role of BMP4 in both activating and suppressing gene expression during PNT at the chromatin level.

We found that HOIL-1L RBR plays a crucial role in regulating LUBAC. HOIL-1L RBR conjugates monoubiquitin onto all LUBAC subunits, followed by HOIP-mediated conjugation of linear chains onto monoubiquitin, and these linear chains attenuate the functions of LUBAC. The introduction of E3-defective HOIL-1L mutants into cells augmented linear ubiquitination, which protected the cells against Salmonella infection and cured dermatitis caused by reduced LUBAC levels due to SHARPIN loss. Our results reveal a regulatory mode of E3 ligases in which the accessory E3 in LUBAC downregulates the main E3 by providing preferred substrates for autolinear ubiquitination.

Without NFI TFs, SCs lose their hair-regenerating capability, and produce skin bearing striking resemblance to irreversible human alopecia, which also displays reduced NFIs. Through single-cell transcriptomics, ATAC-Seq and ChIP-Seq profiling, we expose a key role for NFIB and NFIX in governing super-enhancer maintenance of the key hair follicle SC-specific TF genes. When NFIB and NFIX are genetically removed, the stemness epigenetic landscape is lost. Super-enhancers driving SC identity are decommissioned, while unwanted lineages are de-repressed ectopically.

Upon chromatin docking, KAP1 first associates with RNA Pol II and then recruits a pathway-specific transcription factor (SMAD2) in response to cognate ligands, enabling gene-selective CDK9-dependent pause release.

Here, we take advantage of DENV serotype 2 PDK53 vaccine strain, which recently and successfully completed a phase-3 clinical trial, to identify how this virus is attenuated compared to its wild-type parent, DENV2 16681. Site-directed mutagenesis on a 16681 infectious clone identifies a single G53D substitution in the non-structural 1 (NS1) protein that reduces 16681 infection and dissemination in both Aedes aegypti, as well as in mammalian cells to produce the characteristic phenotypes of PDK53. Mechanistically, NS1 G53D impairs the function of a known host factor, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident ribophorin 1 protein, to properly glycosylate NS1 and thus induce a host antiviral gene through ER stress responses.

We find that these two subtypes are driven by distinct metabolic phenotypes. Loss of genes that drive endodermal lineage specification, HNF4A and GATA6, switch metabolic profiles from classical (pancreatic) to predominantly squamous, with glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β) a key regulator of glycolysis. Pharmacological inhibition of GSK3β results in selective sensitivity in the squamous subtype; however, a subset of these squamous patient-derived cell lines (PDCLs) acquires rapid drug tolerance. Using chromatin accessibility maps, we demonstrate that the squamous subtype can be further classified using chromatin accessibility to predict responsiveness and tolerance to GSK3β inhibitors. Our findings demonstrate that distinct patterns of chromatin accessibility can be used to identify patient subgroups that are indistinguishable by gene expression profiles, highlighting the utility of chromatin-based biomarkers for patient selection in the treatment of PDAC.",0,0.0,{}

Here, we identify CCDC57 as a pleiotropic regulator of centriole duplication, mitosis, and ciliogenesis. Combining proximity mapping with superresolution imaging, we show that CCDC57 localizes to the proximal end of centrioles and interacts with the microcephaly protein CEP63, centriolar satellite proteins, and microtubules. Loss of CCDC57 causes defects in centriole duplication and results in a failure to localize CEP63 and CEP152 to the centrosome. Additionally, CCDC57 depletion perturbs mitotic progression both in wild-type and centriole-less cells. Importantly, its centrosome-targeting region is required for its interaction with CEP63 and functions during centriole duplication and cilium assembly, whereas the microtubule-targeting region is required for its mitotic functions. Together, our results identify CCDC57 as a critical interface between centrosome and microtubule-mediated cellular processes that are deregulated in microcephaly.",1,1.5,"{""Inhibition"": 1}"

Conversely, the role of m6A on the biogenesis and function of circular RNAs (circRNAs) has yet to be addressed. circRNAs belong to a class of covalently closed transcripts produced via a back-splicing reaction whereby a downstream 5' splice donor site fuses to an upstream 3' splice acceptor site. Starting from circ-ZNF609 as a study case, we discover that specific m6As control its accumulation and that METTL3 and YTHDC1 are required to direct the back-splicing reaction. This feature is shared with other circRNAs because we find a significant direct correlation among METTL3 requirement, YTHDC1 binding, and the ability of m6A exons to undergo back-splicing.

These mesenchymal reporter-positive epithelial cells are maintained in adult mice across multiple pregnancies, respond to ovarian hormones, and form organoids. However, no labeled epithelial cells are present in any oviductal or uterine epithelia when mesenchymal cell labeling was induced in adult mice.

Cyclotides have diverse bioactivities, and their cytotoxicity has attracted significant attention for its potential anticancer applications. Hybanthus enneaspermus (Linn) F. Muell is a medicinal herb widely used in India as a libido enhancer, and a previous study has reported that it may contain cyclotides. In the current study, we isolated 11 novel cyclotides and 1 known cyclotide (cycloviolacin O2) from H. enneaspermus and used tandem MS to determine their amino acid sequences. We found that among these cyclotides, hyen C comprises a unique sequence in loops 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 compared with known cyclotides. The most abundant cyclotide in this plant, hyen D, had anticancer activity comparable to that of cycloviolacin O2, one of the most cytotoxic known cyclotides. We also provide mechanistic insights into how these novel cyclotides interact with and permeabilize cell membranes. Results from surface plasmon resonance experiments revealed that hyen D, E, L, and M and cycloviolacin O2 preferentially interact with model lipid membranes that contain phospholipids with phosphatidyl-ethanolamine headgroups. The results of a lactate dehydrogenase assay indicated that exposure to these cyclotides compromises cell membrane integrity. Using live-cell imaging, we show that hyen D induces rapid membrane blebbing and cell necrosis. Cyclotide-membrane interactions correlated with the observed cytotoxicity, suggesting that membrane permeabilization and disintegration underpin cyclotide cytotoxicity.

Site-directed mutagenesis of both cofilin and actin revealed residues critical for sustaining or abrogating the light- and stress-gated response.

Optogenetic activation of the striatopallidal pathway fails to reset pacemaking activity of GPe neurons in mutant mice. Abnormal firing is paralleled by alterations in motor learning. We find that loss of dopamine D2 receptor-dependent inhibition causes increased GABA input at striatopallidal synapses, with subsequent downregulation of hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic nucleotide-gated cation (HCN) channels. Accordingly, enhancing in vivo HCN channel activity or blocking GABA release restores both the ability of striatopallidal inputs to pause ongoing GPe activity and motor coordination deficits.

Inhibition of necroptosis strongly enhances suppression of MuSC expansion in a non-cell-autonomous manner. Prevention of necroptosis in MuSCs of healthy muscles is mediated by the chromatin remodeler CHD4, which directly represses the necroptotic effector Ripk3, while CHD4-dependent Ripk3 repression is dramatically attenuated in dystrophic muscles.

Yet, it has been unclear whether implanted hGPCs are similarly able to remyelinate the diffusely demyelinated adult CNS. We, therefore, ask if hGPCs could remyelinate both congenitally hypomyelinated adult shiverers and normal adult mice after cuprizone demyelination. In adult shiverers, hGPCs broadly disperse and differentiate as myelinating oligodendrocytes after subcortical injection, improving both host callosal conduction and ambulation. Implanted hGPCs similarly remyelinate denuded axons after cuprizone demyelination, whether delivered before or after demyelination. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of hGPCs back from cuprizone-demyelinated brains reveals their transcriptional activation of oligodendrocyte differentiation programs, while distinguishing them from hGPCs not previously exposed to demyelination. These data indicate the ability of transplanted hGPCs to disperse throughout the adult CNS, to broadly myelinate regions of dysmyelination, and also to be recruited as myelinogenic oligodendrocytes later in life, upon demyelination-associated demand.",0,0.0,{}

We show that Notch signaling and ETC attenuation via knockdown of COX7a induces massive over-proliferation. The tumor-like growth is caused by a transcriptional response through the eIF2α-kinase PERK and ATF4, which activates the expression of metabolic enzymes, nutrient transporters, and mitochondrial chaperones. We find this stress adaptation to be beneficial for progenitor cell fitness, as it renders cells sensitive to proliferation induced by the Notch signaling pathway. Intriguingly, over-proliferation is not caused by transcriptional cooperation of Notch and ATF4, but it is mediated in part by pH changes resulting from the Warburg metabolism induced by ETC attenuation.

The onset of fetal rhythms strongly correlates with the timing of a distinct transition in branching and growth rates during a gestational window of high fetal growth demands.

Our results indicate that SRBC-48 functions in a cell-autonomous manner in AWC neurons to protect against infection-associated dendrite degeneration. The absence of SRBC-48 results in a reduced lifespan caused by a pathogen infection early in life that induces dendrite degeneration. The decreased longevity in animals deficient in SRBC-48 is due to uncontrolled activation of immune genes, particularly those regulated by the FOXO family transcription factor DAF-16 that is part of the insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 receptor homolog DAF-2. These results reveal how an infection early in life can not only induce dendrite degeneration but also reduce lifespan.",0,0.0,{}

This model, termed Xpresso, more than doubles the accuracy of alternative sequence-based models and isolates rules as predictive as models relying on chromatic immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) data. Xpresso recapitulates genome-wide patterns of transcriptional activity, and its residuals can be used to quantify the influence of enhancers, heterochromatic domains, and microRNAs.

We demonstrate that Lunapark interacts with mechanistic target of rapamycin complex-1 (mTORC1), a central cellular regulator that coordinates growth and metabolism with environmental conditions. We show that mTORC1 binds Lunapark specifically at three-way junctions, and lysosomes, where mTORC1 is activated, make contact with three-way junctions where Lunapark resides.

Murine and human macrophages were treated with LXR agonists for 48 h before Toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation. Unexpectedly, we observe that, among other cytokines, LXR agonists selectively increase IL1B mRNA levels independently of TLR activation. This effect, restricted to human macrophages, is mediated by activation of HIF-1α through LXR. Accordingly, LXR agonists also potentiate other HIF-1α-dependent pathways, such as glycolysis. Treatment of human macrophages with carotid plaque homogenates also leads to induction of IL1B in an LXR-dependent manner.

This is also the case for IFN-β-deficient animals. Moreover, antibody-mediated IFNAR blocking acutely interferes with neuronal plasticity, whereas a low-dose application of IFN-β has a positive effect on dendritic spine structure. Interfering with IFNAR signaling in different cell types shows a role for cognitive function and synaptic plasticity specifically mediated by astrocytes. Intriguingly, levels of the astrocytic glutamate-aspartate transporter (GLAST) are reduced significantly upon IFN-β treatment and increase following inhibition of IFNAR signaling.

During infection, hGBP1 is recruited to pathogen-containing vacuoles, such as Chlamydia trachomatis inclusions, restricts pathogenic growth, and induces the activation of the inflammasome pathway. hGBP1 has a unique catalytic activity to hydrolyze guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to guanosine monophosphate (GMP) in two consecutive cleavage steps. However, the functional significance of this activity in host defense remains elusive. Here, we generate a structure-guided mutant that specifically abrogates GMP production, while maintaining fast cooperative GTP hydrolysis. Complementation experiments in human monocytes/macrophages show that hGBP1-mediated GMP production is dispensable for restricting Chlamydia trachomatis growth but is necessary for inflammasome activation. Mechanistically, GMP is catabolized to uric acid, which in turn activates the NLRP3 inflammasome.

Here, results of a bioinformatics analysis using a sequence similarity network revealed that phage Fds are most closely related to cyanobacterial Fds that transfer electrons from photosystems to oxidoreductases involved in nutrient assimilation. Structural analysis of myovirus P-SSM2 Fd (pssm2-Fd), which infects the cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus marinus, revealed high levels of similarity to cyanobacterial Fds (root mean square deviations of ≤0.5 Å). Additionally, pssm2-Fd exhibited a low midpoint reduction potential (-336 mV versus a standard hydrogen electrode), similar to other photosynthetic Fds, although it had lower thermostability (Tm = 28 °C) than did many other Fds. When expressed in an Escherichia coli strain deficient in sulfite assimilation, pssm2-Fd complemented bacterial growth when coexpressed with a P. marinus sulfite reductase, revealing that pssm2-Fd can transfer electrons to a host protein involved in nutrient assimilation.

32437639,"C.neoformans Dnmt5 is an unusually specific maintenance-type CpG methyltransferase (DNMT) that mediates long-term epigenome evolution. It harbors a DNMT domain and SNF2 ATPase domain. We find that the SNF2 domain couples substrate specificity to an ATPase step essential for DNA methylation. Coupling occurs independent of nucleosomes. Hemimethylated DNA preferentially stimulates ATPase activity, and mutating Dnmt5's ATP-binding pocket disproportionately reduces ATPase stimulation by hemimethylated versus unmethylated substrates. Engineered DNA substrates that stabilize a reaction intermediate by mimicking a ""flipped-out"" conformation of the target cytosine bypass the SNF2 domain's requirement for hemimethylation. This result implies that ATP hydrolysis by the SNF2 domain is coupled to the DNMT domain conformational changes induced by preferred substrates. These findings establish a new role for a SNF2 ATPase: controlling an adjoined enzymatic domain's substrate recognition and catalysis. We speculate that this coupling contributes to the exquisite specificity of Dnmt5 via mechanisms related to kinetic proofreading.",0,0.0,{}

Using a combination of imaging and Hi-C analyses, we show that PRC1-mediated long-range interactions are independent of CTCF and can bridge sites at a megabase scale. Impairment of PRC1 enzymatic activity does not directly disrupt these interactions. We demonstrate that PcG targets coalesce in vivo, and that developmentally induced expression of one of the target loci disrupts this spatial arrangement.

We demonstrate an RNA-DNA helicase activity in UAP56 and show that its overexpression suppresses R loops and genome instability induced by depleting five different unrelated factors. UAP56/DDX39B localizes to active chromatin and prevents the accumulation of RNA-DNA hybrids over the entire genome.

Here, we demonstrate that HLTF-deficient cells fail to undergo fork reversal in vivo and rely on the primase-polymerase PRIMPOL for repriming, unrestrained replication, and S phase progression upon limiting nucleotide levels. By contrast, in an HLTF-HIRAN mutant, unrestrained replication relies on the TLS protein REV1. Importantly, HLTF-deficient cells also exhibit reduced double-strand break (DSB) formation and increased survival upon replication stress.

Here, using actin cosedimentation, polymerization, and depolymerization assays, along with total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF), confocal, and EM analyses, we show that the N-terminal N-BAR domain of ASAP1 directly binds to F-actin. We found that ASAP1 homodimerization aligns F-actin in predominantly unipolar bundles and stabilizes them against depolymerization. Furthermore, the ASAP1 N-BAR domain moderately reduced the spontaneous polymerization of G-actin. The overexpression of the ASAP1 BAR-PH tandem domain in fibroblasts induced the formation of actin-filled projections more effectively than did full-length ASAP1. An ASAP1 construct that lacked the N-BAR domain failed to induce cellular projections. Our results suggest that ASAP1 regulates the dynamics and the formation of higher-order actin structures, possibly through direct binding to F-actin via its N-BAR domain. We propose that ASAP1 is a hub protein for dynamic protein-protein interactions in mechanosensitive structures, such as focal adhesions, invadopodia, and podosomes, that are directly implicated in oncogenic events.

We find that oncogenic EpdSCs are serine auxotrophs whose growth and self-renewal require abundant exogenous serine. When extracellular serine is limited, EpdSCs activate de novo serine synthesis, which in turn stimulates α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases that remove the repressive histone modification H3K27me3 and activate differentiation programmes.

AMaSiNe automatically calibrates misaligned and deformed slice samples to locate labeled neuronal positions from multiple brain samples into the standardized 3D Allen Mouse Brain Reference Atlas. We exploit the high fidelity and reliability of AMaSiNe to investigate the topographic structures of feedforward projections from the lateral geniculate nucleus to the primary visual area by reconstructing rabies-virus-injected brain slices in 3D space.

However, how DC activation is linked with metabolic reprogramming remains unclear. Here we show that pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), the rate-limiting enzyme in the last step of glycolysis, is critical for LPS-induced DC activation. Upon DC activation, JNK signaling stimulated p300 association with PKM2 for the acetylation of lysine 433, a classic posttranslational modification critical for PKM2 destabilization and nuclear re-localization. Subsequently, nuclear PKM2 partnered with c-Rel to enhance Il12p35 expression, which is important for Th1 cell differentiation. Meanwhile, decreased enzymatic activity of PKM2 due to detetramerization facilitated glycolysis and fatty acid synthesis, helping DCs meet their need for biomacromolecules. Together, we provide evidence for metabolic control of DC activation and offer insights into aberrant immune responses due to dysregulated Th1 functions.",2,6.0,"{""IncreaseAmount"": 1, ""Activation"": 1}"

Here, we combine DNase I hypersensitivity, histone modification, and transcriptional profiling to show that SMARCA4 dramatically increases both the number and magnitude of accessible chromatin sites genome-wide, chiefly by unmasking sites of low regulatory factor occupancy.

Experimental calvarial injury upregulates Ngf in an IL-1β/TNF-α-rich defect niche, with consequent axonal ingrowth. In calvarial osteoblasts, IL-1β and TNF-α stimulate Ngf and downstream NF-κB signaling. Locoregional deletion of Ngf delays defect site re-innervation and blunted repair. Genetic disruption of Ngf among LysM-expressing macrophages phenocopies these observations, whereas conditional knockout of Ngf among Pdgfra-expressing cells does not.

The major effector of centrosome separation is the kinesin Eg5. However, the identity and regulation of Eg5-antagonizing forces is less well characterized. By manipulating candidate components, we find that centrosome separation is reversible and that separated centrosomes congress toward a central position underneath the flat nucleus. This positioning mechanism requires microtubule polymerization, as well as actin polymerization. We identify perinuclear actin structures that form in late G2/early prophase and interact with microtubules emanating from the centrosomes. Disrupting these structures by breaking the interactions of the linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complex with perinuclear actin filaments abrogates this centrosome positioning mechanism and causes an increase in subsequent chromosome segregation errors.

The two stress-responsive pathways directly regulate Sox100B transcription via two separate enhancers. Interestingly, an appropriate level of Sox100B is critical for its function, as its depletion inhibits ISC proliferation via cell cycle arrest, while its overexpression also inhibits ISC proliferation by directly suppressing EGFR expression and additionally promotes ISC differentiation by activating a differentiation-promoting regulatory circuitry composed of Sox100B, Sox21a, and Pdm1.

Loss of POLE4, an accessory subunit of Pol epsilon, has no overt phenotype in worms. In contrast, the combined loss of POLE-4 and RTEL-1 results in embryonic lethality, accumulation of HR intermediates, genome instability, and cessation of DNA replication. Similarly, loss of Rtel1 in Pole4-/- mouse cells inhibits cellular proliferation, which is associated with persistent HR intermediates and incomplete DNA replication.

Of the 1,675 aging-regulated lncRNAs (AR-lncRNAs) identified, the majority are connected to inflammation-related biological pathways. AR-lncRNAs exhibit high tissue specificity; conversely, those with higher tissue specificity are preferentially regulated during aging. White adipose tissue (WAT) displays the highest number of AR-lncRNAs and develops the most dynamic crosstalk between AR-lncRNA and AR-mRNA during aging. An adipose-enriched AR-lncRNA, lnc-adipoAR1, is negatively correlated with aging, and knocking it down inhibits adipogenesis, phenocopying the compromised adipogenic capacity of aged fat.

Therefore, the genomic and developmental effects directly and solely attributable to RUNX1-ETO expression are unclear. To address this, we employ a human embryonic stem cell differentiation system capable of forming definitive myeloid progenitor cells to express RUNX1-ETO in an inducible fashion. Induction of RUNX1-ETO causes extensive chromatin reprogramming by interfering with RUNX1 binding, blocks differentiation, and arrests cellular growth, whereby growth arrest is reversible following RUNX1-ETO removal.

Expansion of VANGL localization to the basolateral membranes of progenitors leads to their death and disruption of the epithelial integrity. VANGL basolateral expansion does not affect apico-basal polarity but acts in the cells where Vangl is mislocalized by reducing Dishevelled and its downstream target ROCK.

Immunization with antigen and Toll-like receptor agonist emulsified in oil leads to an increased differentiation of IFNγ/TNF-α+ polyfunctional Th1 cells compared to an identical immunization in saline. Oil immunization results in a rapid delivery and persistence of antigen in interfollicular regions (IFRs) of the LN, whereas without oil, antigen is distributed in the medullary region. Following oil immunization, CXCL10-producing inflammatory monocytes accumulate in the IFR, which mobilizes antigen-specific CD4+ T cells into this niche.

Furthermore, myeloid-specific Akt1 and Akt2 knockout results in similar phenotypes that are rescued by additional knockout of TSC2, an inhibitor of mTOR.

Here, we evaluated the hypothesis that diabetes augments translation of the Cd40 mRNA. Mice receiving thiamet G (TMG), an inhibitor of the O-GlcNAc hydrolase O-GlcNAcase, exhibited enhanced retinal protein O-GlcNAcylation and increased Cd40 mRNA translation.

RNA-Seq data demonstrate that dAKAP1 binds mRNAs encoding proteins required for mitochondrial metabolism, including succinate dehydrogenase. Functional studies suggest that the loss of dAKAP1-RNA interactions reduces mitochondrial electron transport chain activity. Hence, dAKAP1 plays a previously unappreciated role as a molecular interface between second messenger signaling and local protein synthesis machinery.",0,0.0,{}
32483386,"Tissue remodelling during Drosophila embryogenesis is notably driven by epithelial cell contractility. This behaviour arises from the Rho1-Rok-induced pulsatile accumulation of non-muscle myosin II pulling on actin filaments of the medioapical cortex. While recent studies have highlighted the mechanisms governing the emergence of Rho1-Rok-myosin II pulsatility, little is known about how F-actin organization influences this process. Here, we show that the medioapical cortex consists of two entangled F-actin subpopulations. One exhibits pulsatile dynamics of actin polymerization in a Rho1-dependent manner. The other forms a persistent and homogeneous network independent of Rho1. We identify the formin Frl (also known as Fmnl) as a critical nucleator of the persistent network, since modulating its level in mutants or by overexpression decreases or increases the network density. Absence of this network yields sparse connectivity affecting the homogeneous force transmission to the cell boundaries. This reduces the propagation range of contractile forces and results in tissue-scale morphogenetic defects.",0,0.0,{}
32483387,"Osteosarcoma is a type of aggressive malignant bone tumour that frequently metastasizes to lungs, resulting in poor prognosis. However, the molecular mechanisms of lung metastasis of osteosarcoma remain poorly understood. Here we identify exon-intron fusion genes in osteosarcoma cell lines and tissues. These fusion genes are derived from chromosomal translocations that juxtapose the coding region for amino acids 1-38 of Rab22a (Rab22a1-38) with multiple inverted introns and untranslated regions of chromosome 20. The resulting translation products, designated Rab22a-NeoFs, acquire the ability to drive lung metastasis of osteosarcoma. The Rab22a1-38 moiety governs the function of Rab22a-NeoFs by binding to SmgGDS-607, a GTP-GDP exchange factor of RhoA. This association facilitates the release of GTP-bound RhoA from SmgGDS-607, which induces increased activity of RhoA and promotes metastasis. Disrupting the interaction between Rab22a-NeoF1 and SmgGDS-607 with a synthetic peptide prevents lung metastasis in an orthotopic model of osteosarcoma. Our findings may provide a promising strategy for a subset of osteosarcoma patients with lung metastases.",5,2.5,"{""Complex"": 3, ""Activation"": 2}"

The inflammatory environment within tumours also influences responses to many therapies, including the efficacy of oncolytic viruses2; however, the role of CAFs in this context remains unclear. Furthermore, little is known about the cell signalling triggered by heterotypic cancer cell-fibroblast contacts and about what activates fibroblasts to express inflammatory mediators1,3. Here, we show that direct contact between cancer cells and CAFs triggers the expression of a wide range of inflammatory modulators by fibroblasts. This is initiated following transcytosis of cytoplasm from cancer cells into fibroblasts, leading to the activation of STING and IRF3-mediated expression of interferon-β1 and other cytokines. Interferon-β1 then drives interferon-stimulated transcriptional programs in both cancer cells and stromal fibroblasts and ultimately undermines the efficacy of oncolytic viruses, both in vitro and in vivo.

We find that physiological and oncogenic ERK signaling activation leads to acute metabolic flux stimulation through the de novo purine synthesis pathway, thereby increasing building block availability for RNA and DNA synthesis, which is required for cell growth and proliferation. We demonstrate that ERK2, but not ERK1, phosphorylates the purine synthesis enzyme PFAS (phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase) at T619 in cells to stimulate de novo purine synthesis. The expression of nonphosphorylatable PFAS (T619A) decreases purine synthesis, RAS-dependent cancer cell-colony formation, and tumor growth.

Assembling the envelope properly and maintaining its integrity are matters of life and death for bacteria. Our understanding of the mechanisms of envelope assembly and maintenance has increased tremendously over the past two decades. Here, we review the major achievements made during this time, giving central stage to the amino acid cysteine, one of the least abundant amino acid residues in proteins, whose unique chemical and physical properties often critically support biological processes. First, we review how cysteines contribute to envelope homeostasis by forming stabilizing disulfides in crucial bacterial assembly factors (LptD, BamA, and FtsN) and stress sensors (RcsF and NlpE). Second, we highlight the emerging role of enzymes that use cysteine residues to catalyze reactions that are necessary for proper envelope assembly, and we also explain how these enzymes are protected from oxidative inactivation. Finally, we suggest future areas of investigation, including a discussion of how cysteine residues could contribute to envelope homeostasis by functioning as redox switches.

By microinjection of antisense sequences into in vitro fertilized oocytes and subsequent single-cell RNA-seq of embryos, we identified a specific functional tsRNA group (termed here Gln-TTGs) that participate in the early cleavage of porcine preimplantation embryos, probably by regulating cell cycle-associated genes and retrotransposons.

Due to the absence of the autophagic machinery, nuclear protein aggregates require a solubilization step preceding degradation by the 26S proteasome. Using yeast, we identify a nuclear protein quality control pathway required for the clearance of protein aggregates. The nuclear J-domain protein Apj1 supports protein disaggregation together with Hsp70 but independent of the canonical disaggregase Hsp104. Disaggregation mediated by Apj1/Hsp70 promotes turnover rather than refolding. A loss of Apj1 activity uncouples disaggregation from proteasomal turnover, resulting in accumulation of toxic soluble protein species. Endogenous substrates of the Apj1/Hsp70 pathway include both nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins, which aggregate inside the nucleus upon proteotoxic stress. These findings demonstrate the coordinated activity of the Apj1/Hsp70 disaggregation system with the 26S proteasome in facilitating the clearance of toxic inclusions inside the nucleus.",1,0.0,"{""Activation"": 1}"

The response is characterized by a series of temporally distinct homeostasis-, sensome-, and inflammation-related molecular signatures. We find that a single microglial cell simultaneously upregulates transcripts associated with pro- and anti-inflammatory microglial phenotypes.

Among various autism-associated genes, cortactin binding protein 2 (CTTNBP2) is a cytoskeleton regulator predominantly expressed in neurons and highly enriched at dendritic spines. Here, using Cttnbp2 knockout and ASD-linked mutant mice, we demonstrate that Cttnbp2 deficiency reduces zinc levels in the brain, alters synaptic protein targeting, impairs dendritic spine formation and ultrastructure of postsynaptic density, and influences neuronal activation and autism-like behaviors. A link to autism, the NMDAR-SHANK pathway, and zinc-related regulation are three features shared by CTTNBP2-regulated synaptic proteins. Zinc supplementation rescues the synaptic expression of CTTNBP2-regulated proteins. Moreover, zinc supplementation and administration of D-cycloserine, an NMDAR coagonist, improve the social behaviors of Cttnbp2-deficient mice. We suggest that CTTNBP2 controls the synaptic expression of a set of zinc-regulated autism-associated genes and influences NMDAR function and signaling, providing an example of how genetic and environmental factor crosstalk controls social behaviors.",0,0.0,{}

While altered glucose metabolism in CAFs could fuel cancer cells, how such metabolic reprogramming emerges and is sustained needs further investigation. Studying fibroblasts isolated from patients with benign breast tissues and breast cancer, in conjunction with multiple animal models, we demonstrate that CAFs exhibit a metabolic shift toward lactate and pyruvate production and fuel biosynthetic pathways of cancer cells. The depletion or suppression of the lactate production of CAFs alter the tumor metabolic profile and impede tumor growth. The glycolytic phenotype of the CAFs is in part sustained through epigenetic reprogramming of HIF-1α and glycolytic enzymes. Hypoxia induces epigenetic reprogramming of normal fibroblasts, resulting in a pro-glycolytic, CAF-like transcriptome.

Multicolor lineage tracing reveals that in chronically irradiated skin, patches near hair follicles (HFs) increase in size, whereas those far from follicles do not change. This is explained by proliferation of basal epidermal cells within 60 μm of HF openings. Upon interruption of UVB, patch size near HFs regresses significantly. These anatomical differences in proliferative behavior have significant consequences for the cell of origin of basal cell carcinomas (BCCs). Indeed, a UV-inducible murine BCC model shows that BCC patches are more frequent, larger, and more invasive near HFs.

The motifs enriched in modulated exons implicated the splicing factor Sam68 as a regulator of this program. Sam68 controls splicing of exons with weak branchpoints by directly binding near the 3' splice site and competing with U2AF recruitment. Ablation of Sam68 disrupts splicing regulation of synaptic genes associated with neurodevelopmental diseases and impairs synaptic connections and firing of Purkinje cells, resulting in motor coordination defects, ataxia, and abnormal social behavior.

To determine whether HMCES responds to the ssDNA abasic site in cells, we exploited the activity of apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-like 3A (APOBEC3A). APOBEC3A preferentially deaminates cytosines to uracils in ssDNA, which are then converted to abasic sites by uracil DNA glycosylase. We find that HMCES-deficient cells are hypersensitive to nuclear APOBEC3A localization. HMCES relocalizes to chromatin in response to nuclear APOBEC3A and protects abasic sites from processing into double-strand breaks (DSBs). Abasic sites induced by APOBEC3A slow both leading and lagging strand synthesis, and HMCES prevents further slowing of the replication fork by translesion synthesis (TLS) polymerases zeta (Polζ) and kappa (Polκ). Thus, our study provides direct evidence that HMCES responds to ssDNA abasic sites in cells to prevent DNA cleavage and balance the engagement of TLS polymerases.",0,0.0,{}

Using Drosophila melanogaster, which lacks canonical cannabinoid receptors, we report that the endocannabinoids anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol protect against seizures in multiple fly seizure models. Surprisingly, inhibition of anandamide catabolism renders flies insensitive to protection by anandamide, indicating that anandamide metabolites are responsible for seizure protection. Consistent with this finding, arachidonic acid, a direct metabolite of anandamide, protects against seizures. To identify downstream effectors, we test for a role of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels and find that the TRPV1 antagonist capsazepine blocks the protective effect of anandamide. Also, a targeted genetic screen of TRP channels identifies water witch as a mediator of protection by anandamide. Using a Drosophila model, we reveal the role of arachidonic acid in seizure protection and identify a cannabinoid-receptor-1/2-independent mechanism of endocannabinoid seizure protection.",4,3.0,"{""Inhibition"": 4}"

Here, we characterized routes by which G. stearothermophilus utilizes mono- and disaccharides such as galactose, cellobiose, lactose, and galactosyl-glycerol. The G. stearothermophilus genome encodes a phosphoenolpyruvate carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (PTS) for cellobiose.

Here, we report the results of probing 133 surface-exposed residues in RD3 by single substitutions and deletions to identify side chains that are critical for the inhibitory binding of RD3 to RetGC. We tested the effects of these substitutions and deletions in vitro by reconstituting purified RD3 variants with GCAP1-activated human RetGC1. Although the vast majority of the surface-exposed residues tolerated substitutions without loss of RD3's inhibitory activity, substitutions in two distinct narrow clusters located on the opposite sides of the molecule effectively suppressed RD3 binding to the cyclase. The first surface-exposed cluster included residues adjacent to Leu63 in the loop connecting helices 1 and 2. The second cluster surrounded Arg101 on a surface of helix 3. Single substitutions in those two clusters drastically, i.e. up to 245-fold, reduced the IC50 for the cyclase inhibition. Inactivation of the two binding sites completely disabled binding of RD3 to RetGC1 in living HEK293 cells.

We found that M204-scFv itself partitions into oligomeric forms that inhibit seeding differently, and crystal structures of the M204-scFv monomer, dimer, and trimer revealed conformational differences that explain differences among these forms in binding and inhibition. The efficiency of M204-scFv antibodies to inhibit the seeding by brain tissue extracts from different donors with tauopathies varied among individuals, indicating the possible existence of distinct amyloid polymorphs. We propose that by binding to oligomers, which are hypothesized to be the earliest seeding-competent species, M204-scFv may have potential as an early-stage diagnostic for AD and tauopathies, and also could guide the development of promising therapeutic antibodies.",2,4.0,"{""Complex"": 1, ""Activation"": 1}"

Functionally important AGP glycans are synthesized in the Golgi apparatus, but the relationships among their glycosylation levels, processing, and functionalities are poorly understood.

This root phenotype was associated with an increase in the extent of AGP cell wall association, as demonstrated by Yariv phenylglycoside dye quantification and comprehensive microarray polymer profiling of sequentially extracted cell walls. Characterization of recombinant GH43 variants revealed that the exo-β-1,3-galactosidase activity of GH43 enzymes is hindered by β-1,6 branches on β-1,3-galactans. In line with this steric hindrance, the recombinant GH43 variants did not release galactose from cell wall-extracted glycoproteins or AGP-rich gum arabic. These results indicate that the lack of exo-β-1,3-galactosidase activity alters cell wall extensibility in roots, a phenotype that could be explained by the involvement of galactosidases in AGP glycan biosynthesis.",0,0.0,{}
32497495,"Human tumors with exonuclease domain mutations in the gene encoding DNA polymerase ε (POLE) have incredibly high mutation burdens. These errors arise in four unique mutation signatures occurring in different relative amounts, the etiologies of which remain poorly understood. We used CRISPR-Cas9 to engineer human cell lines expressing POLE tumor variants, with and without mismatch repair (MMR). Whole-exome sequencing of these cells after defined numbers of population doublings permitted analysis of nascent mutation accumulation. Unlike an exonuclease active site mutant that we previously characterized, POLE cancer mutants readily drive signature mutagenesis in the presence of functional MMR. Comparison of cell line and human patient data suggests that the relative abundance of mutation signatures partitions POLE tumors into distinct subgroups dependent on the nature of the POLE allele, its expression level, and MMR status.

To overcome these limitations and facilitate the investigation of miRNA functions in vivo, we have developed a method based on a genetically engineered mouse harboring a conditional Halo-Ago2 allele expressed from the endogenous Ago2 locus. By using a resin conjugated to the HaloTag ligand, Ago2-miRNA-mRNA complexes can be purified from cells and tissues expressing the endogenous Halo-Ago2 allele.

32497497,"Extension of telomeres is a critical step in the immortalization of cancer cells. This complex reaction requires proper spatiotemporal coordination of telomerase and telomeres and remains poorly understood at the cellular level. To understand how cancer cells execute this process, we combine CRISPR genome editing and MS2 RNA tagging to image single molecules of telomerase RNA (hTR). Real-time dynamics and photoactivation experiments of hTR in Cajal bodies (CBs) reveal that hTERT controls the exit of hTR from CBs. Single-molecule tracking of hTR at telomeres shows that TPP1-mediated recruitment results in short telomere-telomerase scanning interactions, and then base pairing between hTR and telomere ssDNA promotes long interactions required for stable telomerase retention. Interestingly, POT1 OB-fold mutations that result in abnormally long telomeres in cancers act by enhancing this retention step. In summary, single-molecule imaging unveils the life cycle of telomerase RNA and provides a framework to reveal how cancer-associated mutations mechanistically drive defects in telomere homeostasis.",0,0.0,{}

However, the physiological relevance of variations in RNAPII elongation kinetics has remained unclear. Here we show in yeast that a RNAPII mutant that reduces the transcription elongation rate causes widespread changes in alternative polyadenylation (APA). We unveil two mechanisms by which APA affects gene expression in the slow mutant: 3' UTR shortening and gene derepression by premature transcription termination of upstream interfering noncoding RNAs. Strikingly, the genes affected by these mechanisms are enriched for functions involved in phosphate uptake and purine synthesis, processes essential for maintenance of the intracellular nucleotide pool. As nucleotide concentration regulates transcription elongation, our findings argue that RNAPII is a sensor of nucleotide availability and that genes important for nucleotide pool maintenance have adopted regulatory mechanisms responsive to reduced rates of transcription elongation.",1,0.0,"{""Inhibition"": 1}"

We found that TOE1 promotes maturation of all regular RNA polymerase II transcribed snRNAs of the major and minor spliceosomes by removing posttranscriptional oligo(A) tails, trimming 3' ends, and preventing nuclear exosome targeting. In contrast, TOE1 promotes little to no maturation of tested U1 variant snRNAs, which are instead targeted by the nuclear exosome. These observations suggest that TOE1 is positioned at the center of a 3' end quality control pathway that selectively promotes maturation and stability of regular snRNAs while leaving snRNA variants unprocessed and exposed to degradation in what could be a widespread mechanism of RNA quality control given the large number of noncoding RNAs processed by DEDD deadenylases.",1,1.5,"{""Activation"": 1}"
32499403,"During mitosis, transcription of genomic DNA is dramatically reduced, before it is reactivated during nuclear reformation in anaphase/telophase. Many aspects of the underlying principles that mediate transcriptional memory and reactivation in the daughter cells remain unclear. Here, we used ChIP-seq on synchronized cells at different stages after mitosis to generate genome-wide maps of histone modifications. Combined with EU-RNA-seq and Hi-C analyses, we found that during prometaphase, promoters, enhancers, and insulators retain H3K4me3 and H3K4me1, while losing H3K27ac. Enhancers globally retaining mitotic H3K4me1 or locally retaining mitotic H3K27ac are associated with cell type-specific genes and their transcription factors for rapid transcriptional activation. As cells exit mitosis, promoters regain H3K27ac, which correlates with transcriptional reactivation. Insulators also gain H3K27ac and CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) in anaphase/telophase. This increase of H3K27ac in anaphase/telophase is required for posttranscriptional activation and may play a role in the establishment of topologically associating domains (TADs). Together, our results suggest that the genome is reorganized in a sequential order, in which histone methylations occur first in prometaphase, histone acetylation, and CTCF in anaphase/telophase, transcription in cytokinesis, and long-range chromatin interactions in early G1. We thus provide insights into the histone modification landscape that allows faithful reestablishment of the transcriptional program and TADs during cell division.",0,0.0,{}

We find that the primary miR-15a stem-loop is not processed on its own but that the presence of the neighboring primary miR-16-1 stem-loop on the same transcript can compensate for this deficiency in cis.

32503839,"Vitamin B12 and other cobamides are essential cofactors required by many organisms and are synthesized by a subset of prokaryotes via distinct aerobic and anaerobic routes. The anaerobic biosynthesis of 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole (DMB), the lower ligand of vitamin B12, involves five reactions catalyzed by the bza operon gene products, namely the hydroxybenzimidazole synthase BzaAB/BzaF, phosphoribosyltransferase CobT, and three methyltransferases, BzaC, BzaD, and BzaE, that conduct three distinct methylation steps. Of these, the methyltransferases that contribute to benzimidazole lower ligand diversity in cobamides remain to be characterized, and the precise role of the bza operon protein CobT is unclear. In this study, we used the bza operon from the anaerobic bacterium Moorella thermoacetica (comprising bzaA-bzaB-cobT-bzaC) to examine the role of CobT and investigate the activity of the first methyltransferase, BzaC. We studied the phosphoribosylation catalyzed by MtCobT and found that it regiospecifically activates 5-hydroxybenzimidazole (5-OHBza) to form the 5-OHBza-ribotide (5-OHBza-RP) isomer as the sole product. Next, we characterized the domains of MtBzaC and reconstituted its methyltransferase activity with the predicted substrate 5-OHBza and with two alternative substrates, the MtCobT product 5-OHBza-RP and its riboside derivative 5-OHBza-R. Unexpectedly, we found that 5-OHBza-R is the most favored MtBzaC substrate. Our results collectively explain the long-standing observation that the attachment of the lower ligand in anaerobic cobamide biosynthesis is regiospecific. In conclusion, we validate MtBzaC as a SAM:hydroxybenzimidazole-riboside methyltransferase (HBIR-OMT).

32503840,"Most characterized protein methylation events encompass arginine and lysine N-methylation, and only a few cases of protein methionine thiomethylation have been reported. Newly discovered oncohistone mutations include lysine-to-methionine substitutions at positions 27 and 36 of histone H3.3. In these instances, the methionine substitution localizes to the active-site pocket of the corresponding histone lysine methyltransferase, thereby inhibiting the respective transmethylation activity. SET domain-containing 3 (SETD3) is a protein (i.e. actin) histidine methyltransferase. Here, we generated an actin variant in which the histidine target of SETD3 was substituted with methionine. As for previously characterized histone SET domain proteins, the methionine substitution substantially (76-fold) increased binding affinity for SETD3 and inhibited SETD3 activity on histidine. Unexpectedly, SETD3 was active on the substituted methionine, generating S-methylmethionine in the context of actin peptide. The ternary structure of SETD3 in complex with the methionine-containing actin peptide at 1.9 Å resolution revealed that the hydrophobic thioether side chain is packed by the aromatic rings of Tyr312 and Trp273, as well as the hydrocarbon side chain of Ile310 Our results suggest that placing methionine properly in the active site-within close proximity to and in line with the incoming methyl group of SAM-would allow some SET domain proteins to selectively methylate methionine in proteins.",0,0.0,{}

Specifically, NXF1 is preferentially required for export of single- or few-exon transcripts with long exons or high A/U content, whereas depletion of TREX complex components preferentially affects spliced and G/C-rich transcripts.

Prokaryotes gain immunity by acquiring short pieces of the invading nucleic acid termed prespacers and inserting them into their CRISPR array. In type II-A systems, Cas1 and Cas2 proteins insert prespacers always at the leader-repeat junction of the CRISPR array. Among type II-A CRISPR systems, three distinct groups (G1, G2, and G3) exist according to the extent of DNA sequence conservation at the 3' end of the leader. However, the mechanisms by which these conserved motifs interact with their cognate Cas1 and Cas2 proteins remain unclear. Here, we performed in vitro integration assays, finding that for G1 and G2, the insertion site is recognized through defined mechanisms, at least in members examined to date, whereas G3 exhibits no sequence-specific insertion. G1 first recognized a 12-bp sequence at the leader-repeat junction and performed leader-side insertion before proceeding to spacer-side insertion. G2 recognized the full repeat sequence and could perform independent leader-side or spacer-side insertions, although the leader-side insertion was faster than spacer-side. The prespacer morphology requirements for Cas1-Cas2 varied, with G1 stringently requiring a 5-nucleotide 3' overhang and G2 being able to insert many forms of prespacers with variable efficiencies. These results highlight the intricacy of protein-DNA sequence interactions within the seemingly similar type II-A integration complexes and provide mechanistic insights into prespacer insertion.

Subsequent studies revealed that mutations or other defects that inhibit cell death allow cells to accumulate, prevent removal of cells with damaged DNA, and increase the resistance of malignant cells to chemotherapy.

Genetic studies have revealed critical homeostatic cellular functions of SIRT6, underscoring the need to better understand which catalytic functions and molecular pathways are driving SIRT6-associated phenotypes. At the physiological level, SIRT6 activity promotes increased longevity by regulating metabolism and DNA repair. Recent work has identified natural products and synthetic small molecules capable of activating the inefficient in vitro deacetylase activity of SIRT6.

32518155,"β2-Glycoprotein I (β2GPI) is an abundant plasma protein displaying phospholipid-binding properties. Because it binds phospholipids, it is a target of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPLs) in antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), a life-threatening autoimmune thrombotic disease. Indeed, aPLs prefer membrane-bound β2GPI to that in solution. β2GPI exists in two almost equally populated redox states: oxidized, in which all the disulfide bonds are formed, and reduced, in which one or more disulfide bonds are broken. Furthermore, β2GPI can adopt multiple conformations (i.e. J-elongated, S-twisted, and O-circular). While strong evidence indicates that the J-form is the structure bound to aPLs, which conformation exists and predominates in solution remains controversial, and so is the conformational pathway leading to the bound state. Here, we report that human recombinant β2GPI purified under native conditions is oxidized. Moreover, under physiological pH and salt concentrations, this oxidized form adopts a J-elongated, flexible conformation, not circular or twisted, in which the N-terminal domain I (DI) and the C-terminal domain V (DV) are exposed to the solvent. Consistent with this model, binding kinetics and mutagenesis experiments revealed that in solution the J-form interacts with negatively charged liposomes and with MBB2, a monoclonal anti-DI antibody that recapitulates most of the features of pathogenic aPLs. We conclude that the preferential binding of aPLs to phospholipid-bound β2GPI arises from the ability of its preexisting J-form to accumulate on the membranes, thereby offering an ideal environment for aPL binding.

Enzymatic assays revealed that the SsCBM-GH16 domain displays endo-(β1,4)-galactosidase activity specifically toward the host-derived αGal epitope Gal(α1,3)Gal(β1,4)Glc(NAc)-R, whereas the SsGH20 domain has a wide spectrum of exo-β-N-acetylhexosaminidase activities, including exo-(β1,3)-N-acetylglucosaminidase activity, and employs this activity to act in tandem with SsCBM-GH16 on the αGal-epitope glycan.

MRSA resistance to β-lactam antibiotics is mediated by two divergons that control levels of a β-lactamase, PC1, and a penicillin-binding protein poorly acylated by β-lactam antibiotics, PBP2a. Expression of genes encoding these proteins is controlled by two integral membrane proteins, BlaR1 and MecR1, which both have an extracellular β-lactam-binding sensor domain. Here, we solved the X-ray crystallographic structures of the BlaR1 and MecR1 sensor domains in complex with avibactam, a diazabicyclooctane β-lactamase inhibitor at 1.6-2.0 Å resolution. Additionally, we show that S. aureus SF8300, a clinically relevant strain from the USA300 clone of MRSA, responds to avibactam by up-regulating the expression of the blaZ and pbp2a antibiotic-resistance genes, encoding PC1 and PBP2a, respectively. The BlaR1-avibactam structure of the carbamoyl-enzyme intermediate revealed that avibactam is bound to the active-site serine in two orientations ∼180° to each other. Although a physiological role of the observed alternative pose remains to be validated, our structural results hint at the presence of a secondary sulfate-binding pocket that could be exploited in the design of future inhibitors of BlaR1/MecR1 sensor domains or the structurally similar class D β-lactamases. The MecR1-avibactam structure adopted a singular avibactam orientation similar to one of the two states observed in the BlaR1-avibactam structure.

Protein factors that mediate both processes, including the 5'-3' exonuclease Xrn1, are responsible for a cross-talk between the two processes that buffers steady-state mRNA levels. However, the roles of these proteins in transcription remain elusive and controversial. Applying native elongating transcript sequencing (NET-seq) to yeast cells, we show that Xrn1 functions mainly as a transcriptional activator and that its disruption manifests as a reduction of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) occupancy downstream of transcription start sites. By combining our sequencing data and mathematical modeling of transcription, we found that Xrn1 modulates transcription initiation and elongation of its target genes. Furthermore, Pol II occupancy markedly increased near cleavage and polyadenylation sites in xrn1Δ cells, whereas its activity decreased, a characteristic feature of backtracked Pol II. We also provide indirect evidence that Xrn1 is involved in transcription termination downstream of polyadenylation sites. We noted that two additional decay factors, Dhh1 and Lsm1, seem to function similarly to Xrn1 in transcription, perhaps as a complex, and that the decay factors Ccr4 and Rpb4 also perturb transcription in other ways. Interestingly, the decay factors could differentiate between SAGA- and TFIID-dominated promoters. These two classes of genes responded differently to XRN1 deletion in mRNA synthesis and were differentially regulated by mRNA decay pathways, raising the possibility that one distinction between these two gene classes lies in the mechanisms that balance mRNA synthesis with mRNA decay.",3,4.5,"{""Inhibition"": 2, ""Activation"": 1}"

Here, we report that the suppression of Nei-like DNA glycosylase 2 (NEIL2), a mammalian DNA glycosylase that specifically removes oxidized bases, is one mechanism through which H. pylori infection may fuel the accumulation of DNA damage leading to GC. Using cultured cell lines, gastric biopsy specimens, primary cells, and human enteroid-derived monolayers from healthy human stomach, we show that H. pylori infection greatly reduces NEIL2 expression. The H. pylori infection-induced downregulation of NEIL2 was specific, as Campylobacter jejuni had no such effect. Using gastric organoids isolated from the murine stomach in coculture experiments with live bacteria mimicking the infected stomach lining, we found that H. pylori infection is associated with the production of various inflammatory cytokines. This response was more pronounced in Neil2 knockout (KO) mouse cells than in WT cells, suggesting that NEIL2 suppresses inflammation under physiological conditions. Notably, the H. pylori-infected Neil2-KO murine stomach exhibited more DNA damage than the WT. Furthermore, H. pylori-infected Neil2-KO mice had greater inflammation and more epithelial cell damage. Computational analysis of gene expression profiles of DNA glycosylases in gastric specimens linked the reduced Neil2 level to GC progression.

Additional experiments disclosed that the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway is highly activated in rbm15-deficient hepatocytes.

The environmental bacterium Geobacter lovleyi has recently been recognized as a key driver of DNRA in nature, but its enzymatic pathway is still uncharacterized. To address this limitation, here we overexpressed, purified, and characterized G. lovleyi NrfA. We observed that the enzyme crystallizes as a dimer but remains monomeric in solution. Importantly, its crystal structure at 2.55-Å resolution revealed the presence of an arginine residue in the region otherwise occupied by calcium in canonical NrfA enzymes. The presence of EDTA did not affect the activity of G. lovleyi NrfA, and site-directed mutagenesis of this arginine reduced enzymatic activity to <3% of the WT levels.

One such coping mechanism that has appeared during evolution is the expression of well-conserved molecular chaperones, such as those that are part of the heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) family of proteins that bind and fold a large proportion of the proteome. Although Hsp70 family chaperones have been extensively examined for the last 50 years, most studies have focused on regulation of Hsp70 activities by altered transcription, co-chaperone ""helper"" proteins, and ATP binding and hydrolysis. The rise of modern proteomics has uncovered a vast array of post-translational modifications (PTMs) on Hsp70 family proteins that include phosphorylation, acetylation, ubiquitination, AMPylation, and ADP-ribosylation. Similarly to the pattern of histone modifications, the histone code, this complex pattern of chaperone PTMs is now known as the ""chaperone code."" In this review, we discuss the history of the Hsp70 chaperone code, its currently understood regulation and functions, and thoughts on what the future of research into the chaperone code may entail.",0,0.0,{}
32518166,"Mitochondrial iron import is essential for iron-sulfur cluster formation and heme biosynthesis. Two nuclear-encoded vertebrate mitochondrial high-affinity iron importers, mitoferrin1 (Mfrn1) and Mfrn2, have been identified in mammals. In mice, the gene encoding Mfrn1, solute carrier family 25 member 37 (Slc25a37), is highly expressed in sites of erythropoiesis, and whole-body Slc25a37 deletion leads to lethality. Here, we report that mice with a deletion of Slc25a28 (encoding Mfrn2) are born at expected Mendelian ratios, but show decreased male fertility due to reduced sperm numbers and sperm motility. Mfrn2-/- mice placed on a low-iron diet exhibited reduced mitochondrial manganese, cobalt, and zinc levels, but not reduced iron. Hepatocyte-specific loss of Slc25a37 (encoding Mfrn1) in Mfrn2-/- mice did not affect animal viability, but resulted in a 40% reduction in mitochondrial iron and reduced levels of oxidative phosphorylation proteins. Placing animals on a low-iron diet exaggerated the reduction in mitochondrial iron observed in liver-specific Mfrn1/2-knockout animals. Mfrn1-/-/Mfrn2-/- bone marrow-derived macrophages or skin fibroblasts in vitro were unable to proliferate, and overexpression of Mfrn1-GFP or Mfrn2-GFP prevented this proliferation defect. Loss of both mitoferrins in hepatocytes dramatically reduced regeneration in the adult mouse liver, further supporting the notion that both mitoferrins transport iron and that their absence limits proliferative capacity of mammalian cells. We conclude that Mfrn1 and Mfrn2 contribute to mitochondrial iron homeostasis and are required for high-affinity iron import during active proliferation of mammalian cells.",4,6.0,"{""Inhibition"": 2, ""Activation"": 2}"

However, the glycosphingolipid synthases required for production of these ceramides have not been well-characterized. Here, we report the identification and characterization of glucuronosylceramide synthase (ceramide UDP-glucuronosyltransferase [Cer-GlcAT]) in Zymomonas mobilis, a Gram-negative bacterium whose cellular membranes contain glucuronosylceramide. On comparing the gene sequences that encode the diacylglycerol GlcAT in bacteria and plants, we found a homologous gene that is widely distributed in the order Sphingomonadales in the Z. mobilis genome. We first cloned the gene and expressed it in Escherichia coli, followed by protein purification using nickel-Sepharose affinity and gel filtration chromatography. Using the highly enriched enzyme, we observed that it has high glycosyltransferase activity with UDP-glucuronic acid and ceramide as sugar donor and acceptor substrate, respectively. Cer-GlcAT deletion resulted in a loss of glucuronosylceramide and increased the levels of ceramide phosphoglycerol, which was expressed in WT cells only at very low levels. Furthermore, we found sequences homologous to Cer-GlcAT in Sphingobium yanoikuyae and Bacteroides fragilis, which have been reported to produce glucuronosylceramide and α-galactosylceramide, respectively. We expressed the two homologs of the cer-glcat gene in E. coli and found that each gene encodes Cer-GlcAT and Cer-galactosyltransferase, respectively.

In addition to ubiquitin-binding and ubiquitin-like domains, they contain a conserved region with similarity to retroviral proteases, but whether and how DDI2 functions as a protease has remained unknown. Here, we show that DDI2 knockout cells are sensitive to proteasome inhibition and accumulate high-molecular weight, ubiquitylated proteins that are poorly degraded by the proteasome. These proteins are targets for the protease activity of purified DDI2. No evidence for DDI2 acting as a de-ubiquitylating enzyme was uncovered, which could suggest that it cleaves the ubiquitylated protein itself. In support of this idea, cleavage of transcription factor NRF1 is known to require DDI2 activity in vivo.

To avoid toxic protein aggregation, cells have evolved nuclear and cytosolic protein quality control (PQC) systems. In response to proteotoxic stress, cells also limit protein synthesis by triggering transient storage of mRNAs and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) in cytosolic stress granules (SGs). We demonstrate that the SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligase (StUbL) pathway, which is part of the nuclear proteostasis network, regulates SG dynamics. We provide evidence that inactivation of SUMO deconjugases under proteotoxic stress initiates SUMO-primed, RNF4-dependent ubiquitylation of RBPs that typically condense into SGs. Impairment of SUMO-primed ubiquitylation drastically delays SG resolution upon stress release. Importantly, the StUbL system regulates compartmentalization of an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-associated FUS mutant in SGs. We propose that the StUbL system functions as surveillance pathway for aggregation-prone RBPs in the nucleus, thereby linking the nuclear and cytosolic axis of proteotoxic stress response.",1,1.5,"{""Ubiquitination"": 1}"

NCX1 palmitoylation occurs dynamically at the cell surface under the control of the enzymes zDHHC5 and APT1. We identify the position of the endogenous exchange inhibitory peptide (XIP) binding site within the NCX1 regulatory intracellular loop and demonstrate that palmitoylation controls the ability of XIP to bind this site. We also show that changes in NCX1 palmitoylation change cytosolic Ca. Our results thus demonstrate the broad molecular consequences of NCX1 palmitoylation and highlight a means to manipulate the inactivation of this ubiquitous ion transporter that could ameliorate pathologies linked to Ca overload via NCX1.",0,0.0,{}

LPS-stimulated B cells of Trpm5-deficient mice exhibit an increased cytosolic calcium concentration, leading to enhanced proliferation and the production of the inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 and CXCL10.

We find that nerve injury increases excitability of layer 5 parvalbumin-expressing neurons in the prelimbic (PL) region of the mPFC from male, but not female, mice. Conversely, nerve injury dampens excitability in somatostatin-expressing neurons in layer 2/3 of the PL region; however, effects are differential between males and females.

Recent evidence shows that partial mitochondrial permeabilization and non-lethal caspase activation occur under certain circumstances, although it remains unclear how failed apoptosis affects cancer cells. Using a cancer cell model to trigger non-lethal caspase activation, we find that melanoma cancer cells undergoing failed apoptosis have a particular transcriptomic signature associated with focal adhesions, transendothelial migration, and modifications of the actin cytoskeleton. In line with this, cancer cells surviving apoptosis gain migration and invasion properties in vitro and in vivo. We further demonstrate that failed apoptosis-associated gain in invasiveness is regulated by the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway, whereas its RNA sequencing signature is found in metastatic melanoma.

Stochastic, genetic, intracellular, and environmental factors affect maintenance of pluripotency and differentiation into early embryonic lineages.

To address this, we focused on a well-established differentiation process to cerebral cortex neural progenitor cells and their neuronal progeny from human pluripotent stem cells. Analysis of 162 differentiation outcomes of 61 stem cell lines derived from 37 individuals showed that most variation occurs along gene expression axes reflecting dorsoventral and rostrocaudal spatial expression during in vivo brain development. Line-independent and line-dependent variations occur, with the latter driven largely by differences in endogenous Wnt signaling activity.

Here, we investigate how subcellular defects associated with Rab7 deficiency are related to the observed developmental defects. Rab7-deficient embryos fail to organize mesodermal tissues due to defects in Wnt-β-catenin signaling. Visceral endoderm (VE)-specific ablation of Rab7 results in patterning defects similar to systemic Rab7 deletion. Rab7 mutants accumulate the Wnt antagonist Dkk1 in the extracellular space and in intracellular compartments throughout the VE epithelium. These data indicate that Rab7-dependent endocytosis regulates the concentration and availability of extracellular Dkk1, thereby relieving the epiblast of antagonism.

Nearly complete coverage is crucial for effective modulation of these structures. We present a framework with computational mapping algorithms for neural drug delivery (COMMAND) to guide multi-bolus targeting of brain structures that maximizes coverage and minimizes off-target leakage. Custom-fabricated chronic neural implants leverage rational fluidic design to achieve multi-bolus delivery in rodents through a single infusion of radioactive tracer (Cu-64).

We report that following glutamate binding, KARs are readily and reversibly trapped at glutamatergic synapses through increased interaction with the β-catenin/N-cadherin complex. We demonstrate that such activation-dependent synaptic immobilization of KARs is crucial for the modulation of short-term plasticity of glutamatergic synapses.

Using Drosophila, we show here that nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)/Relish, an innate immune transcription factor emerging as a signaling node linking nutrient-immune-metabolic interactions, is vital to adapt gut microbiota species composition to host diet macronutrient composition. We find that Relish is required within midgut enterocytes to amplify host-Lactobacillus associations, an important bacterial mediator of nutritional symbiosis, and thus modulate microbiota composition in response to dietary adaptation. Relish limits diet-dependent transcriptional inducibility of the cap-dependent translation inhibitor 4E-BP/Thor to control microbiota composition.

Using scRNA-seq, we show that epicardial-specific deletion of Prmt1 reduced matrix and ribosomal gene expression in epicardial-derived cell lineages. PRMT1 regulates splicing of Mdm4, which is a key controller of p53 stability. Loss of PRMT1 leads to accumulation of p53 that enhances Slug degradation and blocks EMT.

Afadin elimination in motor neuron progenitors results in striking locomotor behavior: left-right limb alternation is substituted by synchronous activation, characteristic of bound gait. We find that afadin function at the neuroepithelium is required for structural organization of the spinal midline and central canal morphogenesis.

SOX9 controls LSPC activity in part by activating both canonical and non-canonical nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling.

Mechanistically, we show that Vangl2 loss maintains young postmitotic granule cells in an immature state, providing increased cellular input for pattern separation. The genetic ablation of Vangl2 disrupts granule cell morpho-functional maturation and further prevents CaMKII and GluA1 phosphorylation, disrupting the stabilization of AMPA receptors. As a functional consequence, LTP at lateral perforant path-GC synapses is impaired, leading to defects in pattern completion behavior.

Arginine methylation is a major PTM that regulates chromatin structure, transcription, and splicing within the nucleus.

Depletion of PRMT8 leads to overabundance of filopodia and mis-localization of excitatory synapses.

We describe a DNA-damage-induced phosphorylation event (Ser784), which selectively enhances chromatin-associated protein degradation mediated by VCP and is required for DNA repair, signaling, and cell survival. These functional effects of Ser784 phosphorylation on DDR correlate with a decrease in VCP association with chromatin, cofactors NPL4/UFD1, and polyubiquitinated substrates.

Despite the resulting 10- to 100-fold decrease in binding affinity, HIV-2UC1 Envs exhibit long-lived activation state and efficient fusion activity.

Here, we show that the exosome nuclear-specific subunit Rrp6p promotes cell survival during heat stress through the cell wall integrity (CWI) pathway, independently of its catalytic activity or association with the core exosome. Rrp6p exhibits negative genetic interactions with the Slt2/Mpk1p or Paf1p elongation factors required for expression of CWI genes during stress. Overexpression of Rrp6p or of its catalytically inactive or exosome-independent mutants can partially rescue the growth defect of the mpk1Δ mutant and stimulates expression of the Mpk1p target gene FKS2. The rrp6Δ and mpk1Δ mutants show similarities in deficient expression of CWI genes during heat shock, and overexpression of the CWI gene HSP150 can rescue the stress-induced lethality of the mpk1Δrp6Δ mutant.

32521280,"Neurons face unique transport challenges. They need to deliver cargo over long axonal distances and to many presynaptic nerve terminals. Rab GTPases are master regulators of vesicular traffic, but essential presynaptic Rabs have not been identified. Here, we find that Rab6, a Golgi-derived GTPase for constitutive secretion, associates with mobile axonal cargo and localizes to nerve terminals. ELKS1 is a stationary presynaptic protein with Golgin homology that binds to Rab6. Knockout and rescue experiments for ELKS1 and Rab6 establish that ELKS1 captures Rab6 cargo. The ELKS1-Rab6-capturing mechanism can be transferred to mitochondria by mistargeting ELKS1 or Rab6 to them. We conclude that nerve terminals have repurposed mechanisms from constitutive exocytosis for their highly regulated secretion. By employing Golgin-like mechanisms with anchored ELKS extending its coiled-coils to capture Rab6 cargo, they have spatially separated cargo capture from fusion. ELKS complexes connect to active zones and may mediate vesicle progression toward release sites.",0,0.0,{}

Surprisingly, treatment with a BET inhibitor, JQ1, rescued the molecular and functional phenotypes of MeCP2 mutant INs. We uncovered that abnormal increases in chromatin binding of BRD4 and enhancer-promoter interactions underlie the abnormal transcription in MeCP2 mutant INs, which were recovered to normal levels by JQ1. We revealed cell-type-specific transcriptome impairment in MeCP2 mutant region-specific human brain organoids that were rescued by JQ1. Finally, JQ1 ameliorated RTT-like phenotypes in mice.

From the crystal structure of the mouse stearoyl-CoA desaturase (mSCD1) it was proposed that Tyr-104, a surface residue located at the distal end of the fatty acyl binding pocket plays a key role in specifying 18C selectivity. We created mSCD1-Y104G to test the hypothesis that eliminating this bulky side chain would create an opening and permit the substrate's methyl end to protrude through the enzyme into the lipid bilayer, facilitating the desaturation of very-long-chain (VLC) substrates. Consistent with this hypothesis, Y104G acquired the ability to desaturate 24C and 26C acyl-CoAs while maintaining its Δ9-regioselectivity. We also investigated two distantly related very-long-chain fatty acyl (VLCFA) desaturases from Arabidopsis, ADS1.2 and ADS1.4, which have Ala and Gly, respectively, in place of the gatekeeping Tyr found in mSCD1. Substitution of Tyr for Ala and Gly in ADS1.2 and ADS1.4, respectively, blocked their ability to desaturate VLCFAs. Further, we identified a pair of fungal desaturase homologs which contained either an Ile or a Gly at this location and showed that only the Gly-containing desaturase was capable of very-long-chain desaturation. The conserved desaturase architecture wherein a surface residue with a single bulky side chain forms the end of the substrate binding cavity predisposes them to single amino acid substitutions that enable a switch between long- and very-long-chain selectivity.

A flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO) produced by A. sativum (AsFMO) was previously proposed to oxidize S-allyl-l-cysteine (SAC) to alliin, an allicin precursor. Here, we present a kinetic and structural characterization of AsFMO that suggests a possible contradiction to this proposal. Results of steady-state kinetic analyses revealed that AsFMO exhibited negligible activity with SAC; however, the enzyme was highly active with l-cysteine, N-acetyl-l-cysteine, and allyl mercaptan. We found that allyl mercaptan with NADPH was the preferred substrate-cofactor combination. Rapid-reaction kinetic analyses showed that NADPH binds tightly (KD of ∼2 μm) to AsFMO and that the hydride transfer occurs with pro-R stereospecificity. We detected the formation of a long-wavelength band when AsFMO was reduced by NADPH, probably representing the formation of a charge-transfer complex. In the absence of substrate, the reduced enzyme, in complex with NADP+, reacted with oxygen and formed an intermediate with a spectrum characteristic of C4a-hydroperoxyflavin, which decays several orders of magnitude more slowly than the kcat The presence of substrate enhanced C4a-hydroperoxyflavin formation and, upon hydroxylation, oxidation occurred with a rate constant similar to the kcat The structure of AsFMO complexed with FAD at 2.08-Å resolution features two domains for binding of FAD and NADPH, representative of class B flavin monooxygenases.

32527724,"The health of a cell depends on accurate translation and proper protein folding, whereas misfolding can lead to aggregation and disease. The first opportunity for a protein to fold occurs during translation, when the ribosome and surrounding environment can affect the nascent chain energy landscape. However, quantifying these environmental effects is challenging because ribosomal proteins and rRNA preclude most spectroscopic measurements of protein energetics. Here, we have applied two gel-based approaches, pulse proteolysis and force-profile analysis, to probe the folding and unfolding pathways of RNase H (RNH) nascent chains stalled on the prokaryotic ribosome in vitro We found that ribosome-stalled RNH has an increased unfolding rate compared with free RNH. Because protein stability is related to the ratio of the unfolding and folding rates, this increase completely accounts for the observed change in protein stability and indicates that the folding rate is unchanged. Using arrest peptide-based force-profile analysis, we assayed the force generated during the folding of RNH on the ribosome. Surprisingly, we found that population of the RNH folding intermediate is required to generate sufficient force to release a stall induced by the SecM stalling sequence and that readthrough of SecM directly correlates with the stability of the RNH folding intermediate. Together, these results imply that the folding pathway of RNH is unchanged on the ribosome. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the ribosome promotes RNH unfolding while the nascent chain is proximal to the ribosome, which may limit the deleterious effects of RNH misfolding and assist in folding fidelity.",0,0.0,{}

Here, using high-resolution MS and monitoring transient reaction kinetics with stopped-flow spectrophotometry, we identified the products from the reactions of l-lysine and l-ornithine, indicating that besides decarboxylating imino acids (i.e. 5-aminopentanamide from l-lysine), l-LOX/MOG also decarboxylates keto acids (5-aminopentanoic acid from l-lysine and 4-aminobutanoic acid from l-ornithine). The reaction of reduced enzyme and oxygen generated an imino acid and H2O2, with no detectable C4a-hydroperoxyflavin. Single-turnover reactions in which l-LOX/MOG was first reduced by l-lysine to form imino acid before mixing with various compounds revealed that under anaerobic conditions, only hydrolysis products are present. Similar results were obtained upon H2O2 addition after enzyme denaturation. H2O2 addition to active l-LOX/MOG resulted in formation of more 5-aminopentanoic acid, but not 5-aminopentamide, suggesting that H2O2 generated from l-LOX/MOG in situ can result in decarboxylation of the imino acid, yielding an amide product, and extra H2O2 resulted in decarboxylation only of keto acids. Molecular dynamics simulations and detection of charge transfer species suggested that interactions between the substrate and its binding site on l-LOX/MOG are important for imino acid decarboxylation.

32527727,"Cells have a remarkable ability to synthesize large amounts of protein in a very short period of time. Under these conditions, many hydrophobic surfaces on proteins may be transiently exposed, and the likelihood of deleterious interactions is quite high. To counter this threat to cell viability, molecular chaperones have evolved to help nascent polypeptides fold correctly and multimeric protein complexes assemble productively, while minimizing the danger of protein aggregation. Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is an evolutionarily conserved molecular chaperone that is involved in the stability and activation of at least 300 proteins, also known as clients, under normal cellular conditions. The Hsp90 clients participate in the full breadth of cellular processes, including cell growth and cell cycle control, signal transduction, DNA repair, transcription, and many others. Hsp90 chaperone function is coupled to its ability to bind and hydrolyze ATP, which is tightly regulated both by co-chaperone proteins and post-translational modifications (PTMs). Many reported PTMs of Hsp90 alter chaperone function and consequently affect myriad cellular processes. Here, we review the contributions of PTMs, such as phosphorylation, acetylation, SUMOylation, methylation, O-GlcNAcylation, ubiquitination, and others, toward regulation of Hsp90 function. We also discuss how the Hsp90 modification state affects cellular sensitivity to Hsp90-targeted therapeutics that specifically bind and inhibit its chaperone activity.

The nAChR transmembrane α-helix, M4, is positioned at the perimeter of each subunit in direct contact with lipids and likely plays a central role in lipid sensing. To gain insight into the mechanisms underlying nAChR lipid sensing, we used homology modeling, coevolutionary analyses, site-directed mutagenesis, and electrophysiology to examine the role of the α-subunit M4 (αM4) in the function of the adult muscle nAChR. Ala substitutions for most αM4 residues, including those in clusters of polar residues at both the N and C termini, and deletion of up to 11 C-terminal residues had little impact on the agonist-induced response. Even Ala substitutions for coevolved pairs of residues at the interface between αM4 and the adjacent helices, αM1 and αM3, had little effect, although some impaired nAChR expression. On the other hand, Ala substitutions for Thr422 and Arg429 caused relatively large losses of function, suggesting functional roles for these specific residues. Ala substitutions for aromatic residues at the αM4-αM1/αM3 interface generally led to gains of function, as previously reported for the prokaryotic homolog, the Erwinia chrysanthemi ligand-gated ion channel (ELIC). The functional effects of individual Ala substitutions in αM4 were found to be additive, although not in a completely independent manner.

In this work, we examined Spo7, a regulatory subunit required for Nem1 catalytic function, to identify residues that govern formation of the Nem1-Spo7 complex. By deletion analysis of Spo7, we identified a hydrophobic Leu-Leu-Ile (LLI) sequence comprising residues 54-56 as being required for the protein to complement the temperature-sensitive phenotype of an spo7Δ mutant strain.

32531202,"It is widely assumed that decreasing transcription factor DNA-binding affinity reduces transcription initiation by diminishing occupancy of sequence-specific regulatory elements. However, in vivo transcription factors find their binding sites while confronted with a large excess of low-affinity degenerate motifs. Here, using the melanoma lineage survival oncogene MITF as a model, we show that low-affinity binding sites act as a competitive reservoir in vivo from which transcription factors are released by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-stimulated acetylation to promote increased occupancy of their regulatory elements. Consequently, a low-DNA-binding-affinity acetylation-mimetic MITF mutation supports melanocyte development and drives tumorigenesis, whereas a high-affinity non-acetylatable mutant does not. The results reveal a paradoxical acetylation-mediated molecular clutch that tunes transcription factor availability via genome-wide redistribution and couples BRAF to tumorigenesis.

Focusing on downstream signaling events of the functionally active 84-104 myelin basic protein (MBP(84-104)) fragment released after nerve injury, we demonstrate that exposing the sciatic nerve to MBP(84-104) via endoneurial injection produces robust mechanical hypersensitivity in female, but not in male, mice. RNA-seq and systems biology analysis revealed a striking sexual dimorphism in molecular signatures of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and spinal cord response, not observed at the nerve injection site. Mechanistically, intra-sciatic MBP(84-104) induced phospholipase C (PLC)-driven (females) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase-driven (males) phospholipid metabolism (tier 1). PLC/inositol trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) and estrogen receptor co-regulation in spinal cord yielded Ca2+-dependent nociceptive signaling induction in females that was suppressed in males (tier 2). IP3R inactivation by intrathecal xestospongin C attenuated the female-specific hypersensitivity induced by MBP(84-104). According to sustained sensitization in tiers 1 and 2, T cell-related signaling spreads to the DRG and spinal cord in females, but remains localized to the sciatic nerve in males (tier 3). These results are consistent with our previous finding that MBP(84-104)-induced pain is T cell-dependent. In summary, an autoantigenic peptide endogenously released in nerve injury triggers multisite, sex-specific transcriptome changes, leading to neuropathic pain only in female mice.

The underlying mechanism by which αkap is maintained and regulated remains unknown. Here, using human cell lines, fluorescence microscopy, and pulldown and immunoblotting assays, we show that α-dystrobrevin (α-dbn), an intracellular component of the dystrophin glycoprotein complex, directly and robustly promotes the stability of αkap in a concentration-dependent manner. Mechanistically, we found that the phosphorylatable tyrosine residues of α-dbn are essential for the stability of α-dbn itself and its interaction with αkap, with substitution of three tyrosine residues in the α-dbn C terminus with phenylalanine compromising the αkap-α-dbn interaction and significantly reducing both αkap and α-dbn accumulation. Moreover, the αkap-α-dbn interaction was critical for αkap accumulation and stability. We also found that the absence of either αkap or α-dbn markedly reduces AChRα accumulation and that overexpression of α-dbn or αkap in cultured muscle cells promotes the formation of large agrin-induced AChR clusters.

We show that successful suppression can be achieved only when AhpC is produced in a dose- and time-dependent manner through a complex mechanism involving activation of the transcriptional regulator OxyR, transcription attenuation, and translation reduction. By analyzing AhpC truncation variants, we demonstrate that reactivity with organic peroxides (OPs) rather than H2O2 is resilient to mutagenesis, implying that OP reduction is the core catalytic function of AhpC. Intact AhpC could be recycled only by its cognate reductase AhpF, and AhpC variants lacking the Prx domain or the extreme C-terminal five residues became promiscuous electron acceptors from the thioredoxin reductase TrxR and the GSH reductase Gor in addition to AhpF, implicating an additional dimension to functional plasticity of AhpC. Finally, we show that the activity of S. oneidensis AhpC is less affected by mutations than that of its Escherichia coli counterpart.

MKT1 is recruited to mRNAs by sequence-specific RNA-binding proteins, resulting in stabilization of the bound mRNA. We here show that PBP1, LSM12, and a 117-residue protein, XAC1 (Tb927.7.2780), are present in complexes that contain either MKT1 or an MKT1-like protein, MKT1L (Tb927.10.1490).

Moreover, XAC1- or MKT1-containing complexes specifically recruited one of the two poly(A)-binding proteins, PABP2, and one of the six cap-binding translation initiation complexes, EIF4E6-EIF4G5. Yeast two-hybrid assay results indicated that MKT1 directly interacts with EIF4G5. MKT1-PBP1 complexes can therefore interact with mRNAs via their poly(A) tails and caps, as well as through sequence-specific RNA-binding proteins. Correspondingly, MKT1 is associated with many mRNAs, although not with those encoding ribosomal proteins. Meanwhile, MKT1L resembles MKT1 at the C terminus but additionally features an N-terminal extension with low-complexity regions.

The DnaB-DnaC complex is recruited to the DnaA complex via stable binding of DnaB to DnaA domain I. The DnaB-DnaC complex is then directed to unwound oriC via a weak interaction between DnaB and DnaA domain III. Previously, we showed that Phe46 in DnaA domain I binds to DnaB. Here, we searched for the DnaA domain I-binding site in DnaB. The DnaB L160A variant was impaired in binding to DnaA complex on oriC but retained its DnaC-binding and helicase activities. DnaC binding moderately stimulated DnaA binding of DnaB L160A, and loading of DnaB L160A onto oriC was consistently and moderately inhibited. In a helicase assay with partly single-stranded DNA bearing a DnaA-binding site, DnaA stimulated DnaB loading, which was strongly inhibited in DnaB L160A even in the presence of DnaC. DnaB L160A was functionally impaired in vivo On the basis of these findings, we propose that DnaB Leu160 interacts with DnaA domain I Phe46 DnaB Leu160 is exposed on the lateral surface of the N-terminal domain, which can explain unobstructed interactions of DnaA domain I-bound DnaB with DnaC, DnaG primase, and DnaA domain III.

32540967,"Protein domain interactions with short linear peptides, such as those of the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain with phosphotyrosine-containing peptide motifs (pTyr), are ubiquitous and important to many biochemical processes of the cell. The desire to map and quantify these interactions has resulted in the development of high-throughput (HTP) quantitative measurement techniques, such as microarray or fluorescence polarization assays. For example, in the last 15 years, experiments have progressed from measuring single interactions to covering 500,000 of the 5.5 million possible SH2-pTyr interactions in the human proteome. However, high variability in affinity measurements and disagreements about positive interactions between published data sets led us here to reevaluate the analysis methods and raw data of published SH2-pTyr HTP experiments. We identified several opportunities for improving the identification of positive and negative interactions and the accuracy of affinity measurements. We implemented model-fitting techniques that are more statistically appropriate for the nonlinear SH2-pTyr interaction data. We also developed a method to account for protein concentration errors due to impurities and degradation or protein inactivity and aggregation. Our revised analysis increases the reported affinity accuracy, reduces the false-negative rate, and increases the amount of useful data by adding reliable true-negative results. We demonstrate improvement in classification of binding versus nonbinding when using machine-learning techniques, suggesting improved coherence in the reanalyzed data sets. We present revised SH2-pTyr affinity results and propose a new analysis pipeline for future HTP measurements of domain-peptide interactions.",0,0.0,{}
32540968,"Defective DNA damage response (DDR) signaling is a common mechanism that initiates and maintains the cellular senescence phenotype. Dysfunctional telomeres activate DDR signaling, genomic instability, and cellular senescence, but the links among these events remains unclear. Here, using an array of biochemical and imaging techniques, including a highly regulatable CRISPR/Cas9 strategy to induce DNA double strand breaks specifically in the telomeres, ChIP, telomere immunofluorescence, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), micronuclei imaging, and the telomere shortest length assay (TeSLA), we show that chromosome mis-segregation due to imperfect DDR signaling in response to dysfunctional telomeres creates a preponderance of chromatin fragments in the cytosol, which leads to a premature senescence phenotype. We found that this phenomenon is caused not by telomere shortening, but by cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) recognizing cytosolic chromatin fragments and then activating the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway and downstream interferon signaling. Significantly, genetic and pharmacological manipulation of cGAS not only attenuated immune signaling, but also prevented premature cellular senescence in response to dysfunctional telomeres. The findings of our study uncover a cellular intrinsic mechanism involving the cGAS-mediated cytosolic self-DNA-sensing pathway that initiates premature senescence independently of telomere shortening.",5,10.5,"{""Activation"": 5}"

In some humans, hCYP11B2 undergoes a unique intron conversion whose function is largely unclear. The intron conversion is formed by a replacement of the segment of DNA within intron 2 of hCYP11B2 with the corresponding region of the hCYP11B1 gene. We show here that the intron conversion is located in an open chromatin form and binds more strongly to the transcriptional regulators histone acetyltransferase P300 (p300), NFκB, and CCAAT enhancer-binding protein α (CEBPα). Reporter constructs containing the intron conversion had increased promoter activity on transient transfection in H295R cells compared with WT intron 2. We generated humanized transgenic (TG) mice containing all the introns, exons, and 5'- and 3'-flanking regions of the hCYP11B2 gene containing either the intron conversion or WT intron 2. We found that TG mice containing the intron conversion have (a) increased plasma aldosterone levels, (b) increased hCYP11B2 mRNA and protein levels, and (c) increased blood pressure compared with TG mice containing WT intron 2. Results of a ChIP assay showed that chromatin obtained from the adrenals of TG mice containing the intron conversion binds more strongly to p300, NFκB, and CEBPα than to WT intron 2.

32540970,"The Src homology 2 (SH2) domain has a highly conserved architecture that recognizes linear phosphotyrosine motifs and is present in a wide range of signaling pathways across different evolutionary taxa. A hallmark of SH2 domains is the arginine residue in the conserved FLVR motif that forms a direct salt bridge with bound phosphotyrosine. Here, we solve the X-ray crystal structures of the C-terminal SH2 domain of p120RasGAP (RASA1) in its apo and peptide-bound form. We find that the arginine residue in the FLVR motif does not directly contact pTyr1087 of a bound phosphopeptide derived from p190RhoGAP; rather, it makes an intramolecular salt bridge to an aspartic acid. Unexpectedly, coordination of phosphotyrosine is achieved by a modified binding pocket that appears early in evolution. Using isothermal titration calorimetry, we find that substitution of the FLVR arginine R377A does not cause a significant loss of phosphopeptide binding, but rather a tandem substitution of R398A (SH2 position βD4) and K400A (SH2 position βD6) is required to disrupt the binding.

Here, we show that the protein kinase Akt acts as a co-adaptor in this complex, and is needed in conjunction with ACAP1 to bind to cargo proteins to promote their recycling. In addition to advancing the understanding of endocytic recycling, we uncover a fundamentally different function in which a kinase acts, as Akt in this case is an effector rather than a regulator in a cellular event.",0,0.0,{}

We identified transcriptionally distinct malignant subpopulations and compared their drug-response and genomic profiles. Malignant subpopulations from the same patient responded strikingly differently to anti-cancer drugs ex vivo, which recapitulated subpopulation-specific drug sensitivity during in vivo treatment. Infiltrating T cells represented the majority of non-malignant cells, whose gene-expression signatures were similar across all donors, whereas the frequencies of T-cell subsets varied significantly between the donors.

Deregulation of the epigenetic landscape induced by the loss of the NSL complex in neural cells causes widespread metabolic defects, including an accumulation of free long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs). Free LCFAs induce a Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-NFκB-dependent pro-inflammatory signalling cascade in neighbouring vascular pericytes that is rescued by TLR4 inhibition.

Disorder is highly conserved and facilitates CTD-CTD interactions, an ability we show is separable from protein sequence and necessary for efficient transcription. We build a data-driven quantitative model, simulations of which recapitulate experiments and support that CTD length promotes initial polymerase recruitment to the promoter and slows down its release from it and that CTD-CTD interactions enable recruitment of multiple polymerases.

It is unknown how the crosslinking contributes to the mechanical properties of tendon or whether crosslinking changes in response to stretching or relaxation. Since their discovery, imine bonds within collagen have been recognized as being important in both crosslink formation and collagen structure. They are often described as acidic or thermally labile, but no evidence is available from direct measurements of crosslink levels whether these bonds contribute to the mechanical properties of collagen. Here, we used MS to analyze these imine bonds after reduction with sodium borohydride while under tension and found that their levels are altered in stretched tendon. We studied the changes in crosslink bonding in tail tendon from 11-week-old C57Bl/6 mice at 4% physical strain, at 10% strain, and at breaking point. The crosslinks hydroxy-lysino-norleucine (HLNL), dihydroxy-lysino-norleucine (DHLNL), and lysino-norleucine (LNL) in-creased or decreased depending on the specific crosslink and amount of mechanical strain. We also noted a decrease in glycated lysine residues in collagen, indicating that the imine formed between circulating glucose and lysine is also stress labile. We also carried out mechanical testing, including cyclic testing at 4% strain, stress relaxation tests, and stress-strain profiles taken at breaking point, both with and without sodium borohydride reduction.

Kindlin proteins are a central cytoplasmic component of these networks, directly binding integrin cytoplasmic domains and mediating interactions with cytoskeletal and signaling proteins. The physiological importance of kindlins is well established, but how the scaffolding functions of kindlins are regulated at the molecular level is still unclear. Here, using a combination of GFP nanotrap association assays, pulldown and integrin-binding assays, and live-cell imaging, we demonstrate that full-length kindlins can oligomerize (self-associate) in mammalian cells, and we propose that this self-association inhibits integrin binding and kindlin localization to focal adhesions. We show that both kindlin-2 and kindlin-3 can self-associate and that kindlin-3 self-association is more robust. Using chimeric mapping, we demonstrate that the F2PH and F3 subdomains are important for kindlin self-association. Through comparative sequence analysis of kindlin-2 and kindlin-3, we identify kindlin-3 point mutations that decrease self-association and enhance integrin binding, affording mutant kindlin-3 the ability to localize to focal adhesions.

Viperin is also notable as one of very few radical SAM-dependent enzymes present in higher animals; however, the enzyme appears broadly conserved across all kingdoms of life, which suggests that it represents an ancient defense mechanism against viral infections. Although viperin was discovered some 20 years ago, only recently was the enzyme's structure determined and its catalytic activity elucidated. The enzyme converts CTP to 3'-deoxy-3',4'-didehydro-CTP, which functions as novel chain-terminating antiviral nucleotide when misincorporated by viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. Moreover, in higher animals, viperin interacts with numerous other host and viral proteins, and it is apparent that this complex network of interactions constitutes another important aspect of the protein's antiviral activity. An emerging theme is that viperin appears to facilitate ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation of some of the proteins it interacts with. Viperin-targeted protein degradation contributes to the antiviral response either by down-regulating various metabolic pathways important for viral replication or by directly targeting viral proteins for degradation. Here, we review recent advances in our understanding of the structure and catalytic activity of viperin, together with studies investigating the interactions between viperin and its target proteins. These studies have provided detailed insights into the biochemical processes underpinning this unusual enzyme's wide-ranging antiviral activity.

We previously reported that SHP2 inhibition in macrophages results in increased cytokine production. Here, we investigated the association between SHP2 inhibition in macrophages and the development of metabolic diseases. Unexpectedly, we found that mice with a conditional SHP2 knockout in macrophages (cSHP2-KO) have ameliorated metabolic disorders. cSHP2-KO mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) gained less body weight and exhibited decreased hepatic steatosis, as well as improved glucose intolerance and insulin sensitivity, compared with HFD-fed WT littermates.

Administration of two specific SHP2 inhibitors, SHP099 and Phps1, improved HFD-induced hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance.

Hox5 induction is achieved by response to retinoic acid signaling, resulting in Jmjd3-dependent derepression of Polycomb chromatin and 3D conformational changes. Hoxa5 drives neurons to settle posteriorly in the PN, where they are monosynaptically targeted by cortical neuron subsets mainly carrying limb somatosensation. Furthermore, Hoxa5 postmigratory ectopic expression in PN neurons is sufficient to attract cortical somatosensory inputs regardless of position and avoid visual afferents. Transcriptome analysis further suggests that Hoxa5 is involved in circuit formation.

Striatal circuits might thus have a unique logic of developmental organization, distinct from those of the neocortex. We explore this possibility in mice by mapping one set of SPNs, those in striosomes, with striatonigral projections to the dopamine-containing substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). Same-age SPNs exhibit topographic striatonigral projections, according to their resident sector. However, the different birth dates of resident SPNs within a given sector specify the destination of their axons within the SNpc.

To address these issues, we perform a comprehensive RNA-seq analysis of aging, ischemic stroke, and their interaction in 3- and 18-month-old mice. We assess differential gene expression across injury status and age, estimate cell type proportion changes, assay the results against a range of transcriptional signatures from the literature, and perform unsupervised co-expression analysis, identifying modules of genes with varying response to injury. We uncover downregulation of axonal and synaptic maintenance genetic program, and increased activation of type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling following stroke in aged mice. Together, these results paint a picture of ischemic stroke as a complex age-related disease and provide insights into interaction of aging and stroke on cellular and molecular level.",2,1.5,"{""Activation"": 2}"
32553171,"Immunodeficiencies are typically caused by loss-of-function mutations in lymphocyte-specific genes. Occasionally, mutations in ubiquitous general-purpose factors, including those affecting essential components of the DNA polymerase epsilon (POLE) holoenzyme, have cell-type-specific consequences. POLE3, one of the four components of the POLE holoenzyme, features a histone fold domain and a unique acidic C terminus, making it a particularly attractive candidate mediating cell type-specific activities of POLE. Mice lacking Pole3 survive up to late embryonic stages, indicating that this subunit is dispensable for DNA replication. The phenotypes of viable hypomorphic and neomorphic alleles are surprisingly tissue restricted and reveal a stage-specific function of the histone fold domain of Pole3 during T and B cell development. Gradual introduction of positively charged residues into the acidic C terminus leads to peripheral lymphopenia of increasing severity. Our findings serve as a paradigm to understand the molecular basis of cell-type-specific non-replicative functions of the ubiquitous POLE complex.",0,0.0,{}

Failure to permanently exit the cell cycle can result in cancer and disease. However, the molecular mechanisms and timing that coordinate differentiation commitment and cell cycle exit are not yet understood. Using live, single-cell imaging of cell cycle progression and differentiation commitment during adipogenesis, we show that a rapid switch mechanism engages exclusively in G1 to trigger differentiation commitment simultaneously with permanent exit from the cell cycle. We identify a molecular competition in G1 between when the differentiation switch is triggered and when the proliferative window closes that allows mitogen and differentiation stimuli to control the balance between terminally differentiating cells produced and progenitor cells kept in reserve, a parameter of critical importance for enabling proper development of tissue domains and organs.",0,0.0,{}
32553192,"Transcription factors (TFs) that bind common DNA motifs in vitro occupy distinct sets of promoters in vivo, raising the question of how binding specificity is achieved. TFs are enriched with intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). Such regions commonly form promiscuous interactions, yet their unique properties might also benefit specific binding-site selection. We examine this using Msn2 and Yap1, TFs of distinct families that contain long IDRs outside their DNA-binding domains. We find that these IDRs are both necessary and sufficient for localizing to the majority of target promoters. This IDR-directed binding does not depend on any localized domain but results from a multitude of weak determinants distributed throughout the entire IDR sequence. Furthermore, IDR specificity is conserved between distant orthologs, suggesting direct interaction with multiple promoters. We propose that distribution of sensing determinants along extended IDRs accelerates binding-site detection by rapidly localizing TFs to broad DNA regions surrounding these sites.",0,0.0,{}
32554463,"SIX2 (SIX homeobox 2)-positive nephron progenitor cells (NPCs) give rise to all epithelial cell types of the nephron, the filtering unit of the kidney. NPCs have a limited lifespan and are depleted near the time of birth. Epigenetic factors are implicated in the maintenance of organ-restricted progenitors such as NPCs, but the chromatin-based mechanisms are incompletely understood. Here, using a combination of gene targeting, chromatin profiling, and single-cell RNA analysis, we examined the role of the murine histone 3 Lys-27 (H3K27) methyltransferases EZH1 (enhancer of zeste 1) and EZH2 in NPC maintenance. We found that EZH2 expression correlates with NPC growth potential and that EZH2 is the dominant H3K27 methyltransferase in NPCs and epithelial descendants. Surprisingly, NPCs lacking H3K27 trimethylation maintained their progenitor state but cycled slowly, leading to a smaller NPC pool and formation of fewer nephrons. Unlike Ezh2 loss of function, dual inactivation of Ezh1 and Ezh2 triggered overexpression of the transcriptional repressor Hes-related family BHLH transcription factor with YRPW motif 1 (Hey1), down-regulation of Six2, and unscheduled activation of Wnt4-driven differentiation, resulting in early termination of nephrogenesis and severe renal dysgenesis. Double-mutant NPCs also overexpressed the SIX family member Six1 However, in this context, SIX1 failed to maintain NPC stemness. At the chromatin level, EZH1 and EZH2 restricted accessibility to AP-1-binding motifs, and their absence promoted a regulatory landscape akin to differentiated and nonlineage cells. We conclude that EZH2 is required for NPC renewal potential and that tempering of the differentiation program requires cooperation of both EZH1 and EZH2.",7,12.0,"{""Inhibition"": 2, ""Activation"": 1, ""DecreaseAmount"": 4}"
32554464,"Pyroptosis is the caspase-dependent inflammatory cell death mechanism that underpins the innate immune response against pathogens and is dysregulated in inflammatory disorders. Pyroptosis occurs via two pathways: the canonical pathway, signaled by caspase-1, and the noncanonical pathway, regulated by mouse caspase-11 and human caspase-4/5. All inflammatory caspases activate the pyroptosis effector protein gasdermin D, but caspase-1 mostly activates the inflammatory cytokine precursors prointerleukin-18 and prointerleukin-1β (pro-IL18/pro-IL1β). Here, in vitro cleavage assays with recombinant proteins confirmed that caspase-11 prefers cleaving gasdermin D over the pro-ILs. However, we found that caspase-11 recognizes protein substrates through a mechanism that is different from that of most caspases. Results of kinetics analysis with synthetic fluorogenic peptides indicated that P1'-P4', the C-terminal gasdermin D region adjacent to the cleavage site, influences gasdermin D recognition by caspase-11. Furthermore, introducing the gasdermin D P1'-P4' region into pro-IL18 enhanced catalysis by caspase-11 to levels comparable with that of gasdermin D cleavage. Pro-IL1β cleavage was only moderately enhanced by similar substitutions. We conclude that caspase-11 specificity is mediated by the P1'-P4' region in its substrate gasdermin D, and similar experiments confirmed that the substrate specificities of the human orthologs of caspase-11, i.e. caspase-4 and caspase-5, are ruled by the same mechanism.

32554465,"Multicellular organisms have multiple genes encoding calponins and calponin-related proteins, some of which are known to regulate actin cytoskeletal dynamics and contractility. However, the functional similarities and differences among these proteins are largely unknown. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, UNC-87 is a calponin-related protein with seven calponin-like (CLIK) motifs and is required for maintenance of contractile apparatuses in muscle cells. Here, we report that CLIK-1, another calponin-related protein that also contains seven CLIK motifs, functionally overlaps with UNC-87 in maintaining actin cytoskeletal integrity in vivo and has both common and different actin-regulatory activities in vitro We found that CLIK-1 is predominantly expressed in the body wall muscle and somatic gonad in which UNC-87 is also expressed. unc-87 mutation caused cytoskeletal defects in the body wall muscle and somatic gonad, whereas clik-1 depletion alone caused no detectable phenotypes. However, simultaneous clik-1 and unc-87 depletion caused sterility because of ovulation failure by severely affecting the contractile actin networks in the myoepithelial sheath of the somatic gonad. In vitro, UNC-87 bundled actin filaments, whereas CLIK-1 bound to actin filaments without bundling them and antagonized UNC-87-mediated filament bundling. We noticed that UNC-87 and CLIK-1 share common functions that inhibit cofilin binding and allow tropomyosin binding to actin filaments, suggesting that both proteins stabilize actin filaments. In conclusion, partially redundant functions of UNC-87 and CLIK-1 in ovulation are likely mediated by their common actin-regulatory activities, but their distinct actin-bundling activities suggest that they also have different biological functions.",5,5.5,"{""Inhibition"": 1, ""Complex"": 3, ""Activation"": 1}"

The necessity of cMyBP-C phosphorylation for proper contractile function is well-established, but the physiological and pathological consequences of decreased cMyBP-C phosphorylation in the heart are not clear. Herein, using intact adult cardiomyocytes from mouse models expressing phospho-ablated (AAA) and phosphomimetic (DDD) cMyBP-C as well as controls, we found that cMyBP-C dephosphorylation is sufficient to reduce contractile parameters and calcium kinetics associated with prolonged decay time of the calcium transient and increased diastolic calcium levels. Isoproterenol stimulation reversed the depressive contractile and Ca2+-kinetic parameters. Moreover, caffeine-induced calcium release yielded no difference between AAA/DDD and controls in calcium content of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. On the other hand, sodium-calcium exchanger function and phosphorylation levels of calcium-handling proteins were significantly decreased in AAA hearts compared with controls. Stress conditions caused increases in both spontaneous aftercontractions in AAA cardiomyocytes and the incidence of arrhythmias in vivo compared with the controls. Treatment with omecamtiv mecarbil, a positive cardiac inotropic drug, rescued the contractile deficit in AAA cardiomyocytes, but not the calcium-handling abnormalities. These findings indicate a cascade effect whereby cMyBP-C dephosphorylation causes contractile defects, which then lead to calcium-cycling abnormalities, resulting in aftercontractions and increased incidence of cardiac arrhythmias under stress conditions. We conclude that improvement of contractile deficits alone without improving calcium handling may be insufficient for effective management of heart failure.",3,3.0,"{""Inhibition"": 2, ""Activation"": 1}"

However, RAS also induces apoptosis and senescence, which may contribute to the eradication of cells with RAS mutations. We previously reported that Ras association domain family member 6 (RASSF6) binds MDM2 and stabilizes the tumor suppressor p53 and that the active form of KRAS promotes the interaction between RASSF6 and MDM2. We also reported that Unc-119 lipid-binding chaperone (UNC119A), a chaperone of myristoylated proteins, interacts with RASSF6 and regulates RASSF6-mediated apoptosis. In this study, using several human cancer cell lines, quantitative RT-PCR, RNAi-based gene silencing, and immunoprecipitation/-fluorescence and cell biology assays, we report that UNC119A interacts with the active form of KRAS and that the C-terminal modification of KRAS is required for this interaction. We also noted that the hydrophobic pocket of UNC119A, which binds the myristoylated peptides, is not involved in the interaction. We observed that UNC119A promotes the binding of KRAS to RASSF6, enhances the interaction between RASSF6 and MDM2, and induces apoptosis. Conversely, UNC119A silencing promoted soft-agar colony formation, migration, and invasiveness in KRAS-mutated cancer cells. We conclude that UNC119A promotes KRAS-mediated p53-dependent apoptosis via RASSF6 and may play a tumor-suppressive role in cells with KRAS mutations.",14,27.5,"{""Complex"": 7, ""Activation"": 7}"

Metabolic stress reduces β-cell sensitivity to GLP-1, yet the underlying mechanisms are unknown. We hypothesized that Glp1r expression is heterogeneous among β-cells and that metabolic stress decreases the number of GLP-1R-positive β-cells. Here, analyses of publicly available single-cell RNA-Seq sequencing (scRNASeq) data from mouse and human β-cells indicated that significant populations of β-cells do not express the Glp1r gene, supporting heterogeneous GLP-1R expression. To check these results, we used complementary approaches employing FACS coupled with quantitative RT-PCR, a validated GLP-1R antibody, and flow cytometry to quantify GLP-1R promoter activity, gene expression, and protein expression in mouse α-, β-, and δ-cells. Experiments with Glp1r reporter mice and a validated GLP-1R antibody indicated that >90% of the β-cells are GLP-1R positive, contradicting the findings with the scRNASeq data. α-cells did not express Glp1r mRNA and δ-cells expressed Glp1r mRNA but not protein. We also examined the expression patterns of GLP-1R in mouse models of metabolic stress. Multiparous female mice had significantly decreased β-cell Glp1r expression, but no reduction in GLP-1R protein levels or GLP-1R-mediated insulin secretion. These findings suggest caution in interpreting the results of scRNASeq for low-abundance transcripts such as the incretin receptors and indicate that GLP-1R is widely expressed in β-cells, absent in α-cells, and expressed at the mRNA, but not protein, level in δ-cells.",2,6.0,"{""DecreaseAmount"": 2}"
32554804,"Trehalose polyphleates (TPP) are high-molecular-weight, surface-exposed glycolipids present in a broad range of nontuberculous mycobacteria. These compounds consist of a trehalose core bearing polyunsaturated fatty acyl substituents (called phleic acids) and a straight-chain fatty acid residue and share a common basic structure with trehalose-based glycolipids produced by Mycobacterium tuberculosis TPP production starts in the cytosol with the formation of a diacyltrehalose intermediate. An acyltransferase, called PE, subsequently catalyzes the transfer of phleic acids onto diacyltrehalose to form TPP, and an MmpL transporter promotes the export of TPP or its precursor across the plasma membrane. PE is predicted to be an anchored membrane protein, but its topological organization is unknown, raising questions about the subcellular localization of the final stage of TPP biosynthesis and the chemical nature of the substrates that are translocated by the MmpL transporter. Here, using genetic, biochemical, and proteomic approaches, we established that PE of Mycobacterium smegmatis is exported to the cell envelope following cleavage of its signal peptide and that this process is required for TPP biosynthesis, indicating that the last step of TPP formation occurs in the outer layers of the mycobacterial cell envelope. These results provide detailed insights into the molecular mechanisms controlling TPP formation and transport to the cell surface, enabling us to propose an updated model of the TPP biosynthetic pathway. Because the molecular mechanisms of glycolipid production are conserved among mycobacteria, these findings obtained with PE from M. smegmatis may offer clues to glycolipid formation in M. tuberculosis.",1,2.0,"{""Translocation"": 1}"
32554805,"The transport activity of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) in cardiac myocytes is modulated by an inhibitory interaction with a transmembrane peptide, phospholamban (PLB). Previous biochemical studies have revealed that PLB interacts with a specific inhibitory site on SERCA, and low-resolution structural evidence suggests that PLB interacts with distinct alternative sites on SERCA. High-resolution details of the structural determinants of SERCA regulation have been elusive because of the dynamic nature of the regulatory complex. In this study, we used computational approaches to develop a structural model of SERCA-PLB interactions to gain a mechanistic understanding of PLB-mediated SERCA transport regulation. We combined steered molecular dynamics and membrane protein-protein docking experiments to achieve both a global search and all-atom force calculations to determine the relative affinities of PLB for candidate sites on SERCA. We modeled the binding of PLB to several SERCA conformations, representing different enzymatic states sampled during the calcium transport catalytic cycle. The results of the steered molecular dynamics and docking experiments indicated that the canonical PLB-binding site (comprising transmembrane helices M2, M4, and M9) is the preferred site. This preference was even more stringent for a superinhibitory PLB variant. Interestingly, PLB-binding specificity became more ambivalent for other SERCA conformers. These results provide evidence for polymorphic PLB interactions with novel sites on M3 and with the outside of the SERCA helix M9. Our findings are compatible with previous physical measurements that suggest that PLB interacts with multiple binding sites, conferring dynamic responsiveness to changing physiological conditions.",1,1.5,"{""Activation"": 1}"

32554807,"The development of the dendritic arbor in pyramidal neurons is critical for neural circuit function. Here, we uncovered a pathway in which δ-catenin, a component of the cadherin-catenin cell adhesion complex, promotes coordination of growth among individual dendrites and engages the autophagy mechanism to sculpt the developing dendritic arbor. Using a rat primary neuron model, time-lapse imaging, immunohistochemistry, and confocal microscopy, we found that apical and basolateral dendrites are coordinately sculpted during development. Loss or knockdown of δ-catenin uncoupled this coordination, leading to retraction of the apical dendrite without altering basolateral dendrite dynamics. Autophagy is a key cellular pathway that allows degradation of cellular components. We observed that the impairment of the dendritic arbor resulting from δ-catenin knockdown could be reversed by knockdown of autophagy-related 7 (ATG7), a component of the autophagy machinery. We propose that δ-catenin regulates the dendritic arbor by coordinating the dynamics of individual dendrites and that the autophagy mechanism may be leveraged by δ-catenin and other effectors to sculpt the developing dendritic arbor.

The global identification of proteins that spatiotemporally interact with STING will provide a better understanding of its trafficking mechanisms and of STING signaling pathways. Proximity-dependent biotin identification (BioID) is a powerful technology to identify physiologically relevant protein-protein interactions in living cells. However, biotinylated peptides are rarely detected in the conventional BioID method, which uses streptavidin beads to pull down biotinylated proteins, because the biotin-streptavidin interaction is too strong. As a result, only nonbiotinylated peptides are identified, which cannot be distinguished from peptides of nonspecifically pull-downed proteins. Here, we developed a simple method to efficiently and specifically enrich biotinylated peptides using Tamavidin 2-REV, an engineered avidin-like protein with reversible biotin-binding capability. Using RAW264.7 macrophages stably expressing TurboID-fused STING, we identified and quantified >4,000 biotinylated peptides of STING-proximal proteins. Various endoplasmic reticulum-associated proteins were biotinylated in unstimulated cells, and STING activation caused biotinylation of many proteins located in the Golgi and endosomes. These proteins included those known to interact with activated STING, such as TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), several palmitoyl transferases, and p62/sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1). Furthermore, interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3), an endolysosome-localized antiviral protein, bound to STING at the late activation stage.

Here, we examined this binding activity using fluorescence anisotropy with a 6-carboxyfluorescein-labeled ICE-like oligomer (FAM-ICE). In the presence of Mn2+, Irr addition increased the fluorescence anisotropy, corresponding to formation of the Irr-ICE complex. The addition of EDTA to the Irr-ICE complex reduced fluorescence anisotropy, but fluorescence was recovered after Mn2+ addition, indicating that Mn2+ binding is a prerequisite for complex formation. Binding activity toward ICE was lost upon introduction of substitutions in a His-cluster region of Irr, revealing that Mn2+ binds to this region. We observed that the His-cluster region is also the heme binding site; results from fluorescence anisotropy and electrophoretic mobility shift analyses disclosed that the addition of a half-equivalent of heme dissociates Irr from ICE, likely because of Mn2+ release due to heme binding. We hypothesized that heme binding to another heme binding site, Cys-29, would also inhibit the formation of the Irr-ICE complex because it is proximal to the ICE binding site, which was supported by the loss of ICE binding activity in a Cys-29-mutated Irr.

Each protein provides entry into diverse plant natural products classes, and our experiments suggest a common biochemical mechanism in binding and stabilizing distinct plant phenol-derived mono- and bis-quinone methide intermediates during different C-C and C-O bond-forming processes. These observations provide key insights into both their appearance and functional diversification of DPs during land plant evolution/adaptation.

32565425,"Many microbial secondary metabolites are produced by multienzyme complexes comprising nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) and polyketide synthases (PKSs). The ketosynthase (KS) domains of polyketide synthase normally catalyze the decarboxylative Claisen condensation of acyl and malonyl blocks to extend the polyketide chain. However, the terminal KS domain in tenuazonic acid synthetase 1 (TAS1) from the fungus Pyricularia oryzae conducts substrate cyclization. Here, we report on the unique features of the KS domain in TAS1. We observed that this domain is monomeric, not dimeric as is typical for KSs. Analysis of a 1.68-Å resolution crystal structure suggests that the substrate cyclization is triggered via proton abstraction from the active methylene moiety in the substrate by a catalytic His-322 residue. Additionally, we show that TAS1 KS promiscuously accepts aminoacyl substrates and that this promiscuity can be increased by a single amino acid substitution in the substrate-binding pocket of the enzyme. These findings provide insight into a KS domain that accepts the amino acid-containing substrate in an NRPS-PKS hybrid enzyme and provide hints to the substrate cyclization mechanism performed by the KS domain in the biosynthesis of the mycotoxin tenuazonic acid.",1,0.0,"{""Inhibition"": 1}"
32571872,"The sequence-specific RNA-binding proteins PTBP1 (polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1) and HNRNP L (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L) protect mRNAs from nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) by preventing the UPF1 RNA helicase from associating with potential decay targets. Here, by analyzing in vitro helicase activity, dissociation of UPF1 from purified mRNPs, and transcriptome-wide UPF1 RNA binding, we present the mechanistic basis for inhibition of NMD by PTBP1. Unlike mechanisms of RNA stabilization that depend on direct competition for binding sites among protective RNA-binding proteins and decay factors, PTBP1 promotes displacement of UPF1 already bound to potential substrates. Our results show that PTBP1 directly exploits the tendency of UPF1 to release RNA upon ATP binding and hydrolysis. We further find that UPF1 sensitivity to PTBP1 is coordinated by a regulatory loop in domain 1B of UPF1. We propose that the UPF1 regulatory loop and protective proteins control kinetic proofreading of potential NMD substrates, presenting a new model for RNA helicase regulation and target selection in the NMD pathway.",4,6.0,"{""Inhibition"": 1, ""Activation"": 3}"

It has been reported that runt-related transcription factor 1 (Runx1) is expressed in osteoblast progenitors, pre-osteoblasts, and mature osteoblasts; yet, surprisingly, the exact function of RUNX1 in osteoblast maturation and bone formation remains unknown. Here, we generated and characterized a pre-osteoblast and differentiating chondrocyte-specific Runx1 conditional knockout mouse model to study RUNX1's function in bone formation. Runx1 ablation in osteoblast precursors and differentiating chondrocytes via osterix-Cre (Osx-Cre) resulted in an osteoporotic phenotype and decreased bone density in the long bones and skulls of Runx1f/fOsx-Cre mice compared with Runx1f/f and Osx-Cre mice. RUNX1 deficiency reduced the expression of SRY-box transcription factor 9 (SOX9), Indian hedgehog signaling molecule (IHH), Patched (PTC), and cyclin D1 in the growth plate, and also reduced the expression of osteocalcin (OCN), OSX, activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), and RUNX2 in osteoblasts. ChIP assays and promoter activity mapping revealed that RUNX1 directly associates with the Runx2 gene promoter and up-regulates Runx2 expression. Furthermore, the ChIP data also showed that RUNX1 associates with the Ocn promoter. In conclusion, RUNX1 up-regulates the expression of Runx2 and multiple bone-specific genes, and plays an indispensable role in bone formation and homeostasis in both trabecular and cortical bone.

To investigate its contribution to copper resistance, here we undertook a structural and biochemical characterization of the CopG protein from Pseudomonas aeruginosa Results from biochemical analyses of CopG purified under aerobic conditions indicate that it is a green copper-binding protein that displays absorbance maxima near 411, 581, and 721 nm and is monomeric in solution. Determination of the three-dimensional structure by X-ray crystallography revealed that CopG consists of a thioredoxin domain with a C-terminal extension that contributes to metal binding. We noted that adjacent to the CxCC motif is a cluster of four copper ions bridged by cysteine sulfur atoms. Structures of CopG in two oxidation states support the assignment of this protein as an oxidoreductase.

They have been implicated in a variety of biochemical pathways but the physiologically relevant target of phosphatase activity has eluded 20 years of investigation. Here, we show that PRL3 catalytic activity is not required in a mouse model of metastasis. PRL3 binds and inhibits CNNM4, a membrane protein associated with magnesium transport. Analysis of PRL3 mutants specifically defective in either CNNM-binding or phosphatase activity demonstrate that CNNM binding is necessary and sufficient to promote tumor metastasis. As PRLs do have phosphatase activity, they are in fact pseudo-pseudophosphatases. Phosphatase activity leads to formation of phosphocysteine, which blocks CNNM binding and may play a regulatory role. We show levels of PRL cysteine phosphorylation vary in response to culture conditions and in different tissues. Examination of related protein phosphatases shows the stability of phosphocysteine is a unique and evolutionarily conserved property of PRLs.

Additionally, expression levels of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4GI (eIF4GI) and of its homolog, death-associated protein 5 (DAP5), are elevated. By examining the 5' UTRs of HIF-1α, FGF-9, and p53 mRNAs and using fluorescence anisotropy binding studies, luciferase reporter-based in vitro translation assays, and mutational analyses, we demonstrate here that eIF4GI and DAP5 specifically bind to the 5' UTRs of these cap-independently translated mRNAs. Surprisingly, we found that the eIF4E-binding domain of eIF4GI increases not only the binding affinity but also the selectivity among these mRNAs. We further demonstrate that the affinities of eIF4GI and DAP5 binding to these 5' UTRs correlate with the efficiency with which these factors drive cap-independent translation of these mRNAs. Integrating the results of our binding and translation assays, we conclude that eIF4GI or DAP5 is critical for recruitment of a specific subset of mRNAs to the ribosome, providing mechanistic insight into their cap-independent translation.",1,3.0,"{""Complex"": 1}"

The structures revealed significant structural similarities to those of a human MutL homolog, postmeiotic segregation increased 2 (PMS2). We introduced five Lynch syndrome-associated mutations clinically found in human PMS2 into the aqMutL NTD and investigated the protein stability, ATPase activity, and DNA-binding ability of these protein variants. Among the mutations studied, the most unexpected results were obtained for the residue Ser34. Ser34 (Ser46 in PMS2) is located at a previously identified Bergerat ATP-binding fold. We found that the S34I aqMutL NTD retains ATPase and DNA-binding activities. Interestingly, CD spectrometry and trypsin-limited proteolysis indicated the disruption of a secondary structure element of the S34I NTD, destabilizing the overall structure of the aqMutL NTD. In agreement with this, the recombinant human PMS2 S46I NTD was easily digested in the host Escherichia coli cells. Moreover, other mutations resulted in reduced DNA-binding or ATPase activity.

Elucidation of the molecular pathogenic mechanism of the disease and discovery of effective therapies still represents a challenging medical issue. The in vitro preparation of amyloid fibrils that exhibit structural and biochemical properties closely similar to those of natural fibrils is central to improving our understanding of the biophysical basis of amyloid formation in vivo and may offer an important tool for drug discovery.

The free energies for fibril formation were -12.36, -8.10, and -10.61 kcal mol-1, respectively. The fibrils generated via plasmin cleavage were more stable than those prepared at low pH and were thermodynamically and morphologically similar to natural fibrils extracted from human amyloidotic tissue.

According to the most optimistic projections, it will take more than a year to develop a vaccine, so the best short-term strategy may lie in identifying virus-specific targets for small molecule-based interventions. All coronaviruses utilize a molecular mechanism called programmed -1 ribosomal frameshift (-1 PRF) to control the relative expression of their proteins. Previous analyses of SARS-CoV have revealed that it employs a structurally unique three-stemmed mRNA pseudoknot that stimulates high -1 PRF rates and that it also harbors a -1 PRF attenuation element. Altering -1 PRF activity impairs virus replication, suggesting that this activity may be therapeutically targeted. Here, we comparatively analyzed the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 frameshift signals. Structural and functional analyses revealed that both elements promote similar -1 PRF rates and that silent coding mutations in the slippery sites and in all three stems of the pseudoknot strongly ablate -1 PRF activity. We noted that the upstream attenuator hairpin activity is also functionally retained in both viruses, despite differences in the primary sequence in this region. Small-angle X-ray scattering analyses indicated that the pseudoknots in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have the same conformation.

The superfamily member MtcB is found in the human intestinal isolate Eubacterium limosum ATCC 8486, an acetogen that can grow by demethylation of l-carnitine. Here, we demonstrate that MtcB catalyzes l-carnitine demethylation. When growing on l-carnitine, E. limosum excreted the unusual biological product norcarnitine as well as acetate, butyrate, and caproate. Cellular extracts of E. limosum grown on l-carnitine, but not lactate, methylated cob-(I)alamin or tetrahydrofolate using l-carnitine as methyl donor. MtcB, along with the corrinoid protein MtqC and the methylcorrinoid:tetrahydrofolate methyltransferase MtqA, were much more abundant in E. limosum cells grown on l-carnitine than on lactate.

Initially viewed as receptors whose signaling via G proteins is delimited to the plasma membrane, it is now recognized that GPCRs signal also at various intracellular locations, and the mechanisms and (patho)physiological relevance of such signaling modes are actively investigated. The propensity of GPCRs to adopt different signaling modes is largely encoded in the structural plasticity of the receptors themselves and of their signaling complexes. Here, we review emerging modes of GPCR signaling via endosomal membranes and the physiological implications of such signaling modes.

Paradoxically, in cells, SPIN90 appears to favour a formin-dominated cortex.

Unlike in other members of this enzyme class, a second zinc ion was present in the β-CASP domain that leads to structural reorientation of the putative DNA-binding surface and extends the substrate-binding pocket to a new pocket, pocket III.

Using conditional gene targeting in mice, we demonstrate that genetic ablation of the small GTPase Rhoa in adult microglia is sufficient to trigger spontaneous microglia activation, producing a neurological phenotype (including synapse and neuron loss, impairment of long-term potentiation [LTP], formation of β-amyloid plaques, and memory deficits). Mechanistically, loss of Rhoa in microglia triggers Src activation and Src-mediated tumor necrosis factor (TNF) production, leading to excitotoxic glutamate secretion. Inhibiting Src in microglia Rhoa-deficient mice attenuates microglia dysregulation and the ensuing neurological phenotype. We also find that the Rhoa/Src signaling pathway is disrupted in microglia of the APP/PS1 mouse model of Alzheimer disease and that low doses of Aβ oligomers trigger microglia neurotoxic polarization through the disruption of Rhoa-to-Src signaling.

However, the mechanisms underlying that remodeling remain largely unknown. Whisker sensory nerve injury drives functional remodeling in the somatosensory thalamus: the number of afferent inputs to each thalamic neuron increases from one to many. Here, we report that extrasynaptic γ-aminobutyric acid-type A receptor (GABAAR)-mediated tonic inhibition is necessary for that remodeling. Extrasynaptic GABAAR currents were potentiated rapidly after nerve injury in advance of remodeling. Pharmacological activation of the thalamic extrasynaptic GABAARs in intact mice induced similar remodeling. Notably, conditional deletion of extrasynaptic GABAARs in the thalamus rescued both the injury-induced remodeling and the ectopic mechanical hypersensitivity.

Proper anchorage and sufficient density (clustering) of endothelial receptors are required for efficient leukocyte capture and rolling. We demonstrate that a polarized spectrin network dictates the stability of the endothelial cytoskeleton, which is attached to the apical membrane, at least in part, by the abundant transmembrane protein CD44. Single-particle tracking revealed that CD44 undergoes prolonged periods of immobilization as it tethers to the cytoskeleton. The CD44-spectrin ""picket fence"" alters the behavior of bystander molecules-notably, selectins-curtailing their mobility, inducing their apical accumulation, and favoring their clustering within caveolae. Accordingly, depletion of either spectrin or CD44 virtually eliminated leukocyte rolling and adhesion to the endothelium.

Integrating these data with human and mouse data, we find that enhancers containing trait-associated variants are preferentially conserved. In contrast, most human-specific enhancers are highly variable between individuals, with a subset failing to contact promoters. These are located further away from genes and more often reside in inactive B-compartments.

We find that most drugs affect both proliferation and death, but in different proportions and with different relative timing. This causes a non-uniform relationship between relative and fractional response measurements. To unify these measurements, we created a data visualization and analysis platform called drug GRADE, which characterizes the degree to which death contributes to an observed drug response.

How these cells interact and contribute to lung carcinogenesis remains elusive. Using G12DKRAS- and V600EBRAF-driven mouse lung models, we identify the pleiotropic glycoprotein stanniocalcin-1 (STC1) as a regulator of TAM-TAF interactions. STC1 is secreted by TAFs and suppresses TAM differentiation, at least in part, by sequestering the binding of GRP94, an autocrine macrophage-differentiation-inducing factor, to its cognate scavenger receptors. The accumulation of mature TAMs in the Stc1-deficient lung leads to enhanced secretion of TGF-β1 and, thus, TAF accumulation in the TME. Consistent with the mouse data, in human lung adenocarcinoma, STC1 expression is restricted to myofibroblasts, and a significant increase of naive macrophages is detected in STC1-high compared with STC1-low cases.

Interestingly, ERα is shown to directly bind with eRNAs by its DNA-binding domain. These eRNAs help with the formation of a specific ERα-centered transcriptional complex and promote the association of the histone demethylase KDM2A, which dismisses RNA polymerase II from designated enhancers and suppresses the transcription of target genes.

Accordingly, activating mTOR signaling by deleting tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (Tsc2) or overexpression of SREBP-1/2 is sufficient to increase FADS2 mRNA expression and sapienate metabolism in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and U87 glioblastoma cells, respectively. Conversely, inhibiting mTOR signaling decreases FADS2 expression and sapienate biosynthesis in MEFs with Tsc2 deletion, HUH7 hepatocellular carcinoma cells, and orthotopic HUH7 liver xenografts.

Here, we identified another mechanism by which WDR-48 regulates USP-46. We found that increased expression of WDR-48, but not WDR-20, promotes USP-46 abundance in mammalian cells in culture and in C. elegans neurons in vivo Inhibition of the proteasome increased USP-46 abundance, and this effect was nonadditive with increased WDR-48 expression. We found that USP-46 is ubiquitinated and that expression of WDR-48 reduces the levels of ubiquitin-USP-46 conjugates and increases the t1/2 of USP-46. A point-mutated WDR-48 variant that disrupts binding to USP-46 was unable to promote USP-46 abundance in vivo Finally, siRNA-mediated knockdown of wdr48 destabilizes USP46 in mammalian cells. Together, these results support a model in which WDR-48 binds and stabilizes USP-46 protein levels by preventing the ubiquitination and degradation of USP-46 in the proteasome. Given that a large number of USPs interact with WDR proteins, we propose that stabilization of DUBs by their interacting WDR proteins may be a conserved and widely used mechanism that controls DUB availability and function.",5,11.0,"{""DecreaseAmount"": 1, ""Ubiquitination"": 1, ""Inhibition"": 1, ""Activation"": 1, ""Complex"": 1}"
32587091,"The transcription factor NF-ĸB is a master regulator of the innate immune response and plays a central role in inflammatory diseases by mediating the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Ubiquitination-triggered proteasomal degradation of DNA-bound NF-ĸB strongly limits the expression of its target genes. Conversely, USP7 (deubiquitinase ubiquitin-specific peptidase 7) opposes the activities of E3 ligases, stabilizes DNA-bound NF-ĸB, and thereby promotes NF-ĸB-mediated transcription. Using gene expression and synthetic peptide arrays on membrane support and overlay analyses, we found here that inhibiting USP7 increases NF-ĸB ubiquitination and degradation, prevents Toll-like receptor-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, and represents an effective strategy for controlling inflammation. However, the broad regulatory roles of USP7 in cell death pathways, chromatin, and DNA damage responses limit the use of catalytic inhibitors of USP7 as anti-inflammatory agents. To this end, we identified an NF-ĸB-binding site in USP7, ubiquitin-like domain 2, that selectively mediates interactions of USP7 with NF-ĸB subunits but is dispensable for interactions with other proteins. Moreover, we found that the amino acids 757LDEL760 in USP7 critically contribute to the interaction with the p65 subunit of NF-ĸB. Our findings support the notion that USP7 activity could be potentially targeted in a substrate-selective manner through the development of noncatalytic inhibitors of this deubiquitinase to abrogate NF-ĸB activity.",3,4.5,"{""Activation"": 3}"

The key function of Vif is to disrupt the antiviral activity of host APOBEC3 (apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic subunit 3) proteins, which mutate viral nucleic acids. Inside the cell, Vif binds to the host cell proteins Elongin-C, Elongin-B, and core-binding factor subunit β, forming a four-protein complex called VCBC. The structure of VCBC-Cullin5 has recently been solved by X-ray crystallography, and, using molecular dynamics simulations, the dynamics of VCBC have been characterized. Here, we applied time-lapse high-speed atomic force microscopy to visualize the conformational changes of the VCBC complex. We determined the three most favorable conformations of this complex, which we identified as the triangle, dumbbell, and globular structures. Moreover, we characterized the dynamics of each of these structures. Our data revealed the very dynamic behavior of all of them, with the triangle and dumbbell structures being the most dynamic.

The small ∼30-kb ssRNA genome of coronaviruses makes them adept at cross-species spread while enabling a robust understanding of all of the proteins the viral genome encodes. We have employed protein modeling, molecular dynamics simulations, evolutionary mapping, and 3D printing to gain a full proteome- and dynamicome-level understanding of SARS-CoV-2. We established the Viral Integrated Structural Evolution Dynamic Database (VIStEDD at RRID:SCR_018793) to facilitate future discoveries and educational use. Here, we highlight the use of VIStEDD for nsp6, nucleocapsid (N), and spike (S) surface glycoprotein. For both nsp6 and N, we found highly conserved surface amino acids that likely drive protein-protein interactions. In characterizing viral S protein, we developed a quantitative dynamics cross-correlation matrix to gain insights into its interactions with the angiotensin I-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-solute carrier family 6 member 19 (SLC6A19) dimer. Using this quantitative matrix, we elucidated 47 potential functional missense variants from genomic databases within ACE2/SLC6A19/transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), warranting genomic enrichment analyses in SARS-CoV-2 patients. These variants had ultralow frequency but existed in males hemizygous for ACE2. Two ACE2 noncoding variants (rs4646118 and rs143185769) present in ∼9% of individuals of African descent may regulate ACE2 expression and may be associated with increased susceptibility of African Americans to SARS-CoV-2.

Here we modified yeast translation complex profile sequencing (TCP-seq), related to ribosome profiling, and adapted it for mammalian cells. Human TCP-seq, capable of capturing footprints of 40S subunits (40Ss) in addition to 80S ribosomes (80Ss), revealed that mammalian and yeast 40Ss distribute similarly across 5'TRs, indicating considerable evolutionary conservation. We further developed yeast and human selective TCP-seq (Sel-TCP-seq), enabling selection of 40Ss and 80Ss associated with immuno-targeted factors. Sel-TCP-seq demonstrated that eIF2 and eIF3 travel along 5' UTRs with scanning 40Ss to successively dissociate upon AUG recognition; notably, a proportion of eIF3 lingers on during the initial elongation cycles.

To promote elongation, eIF3 interacts with 80S ribosomes translating the first ∼60 codons and serves to recruit protein quality-control factors, functions required for normal mitochondrial physiology. Accordingly, eIF3e+/- mice accumulate defective mitochondria in skeletal muscle and show a progressive decline in muscle strength.

We discover that eukaryotic initiation factor 3B (eIF3B,) eIF4G1, and eIF4E remain bound to 80S ribosomes as they begin translating, with a decay half-length of ∼12 codons.

We used HiCorr to compare the high-resolution maps of chromatin interactions from 10 tissue or cell types with a focus on neurogenesis and brain tissues. We found that dynamic chromatin loops are better hallmarks for cellular differentiation than compartment switching. HiCorr allowed direct observation of cell-type- and differentiation-specific E-P aggregates spanning large neighborhoods, suggesting a mechanism that stabilizes enhancer contacts during development.

Next, we characterize the in vivo function of a circRNA generated by the sulfateless gene (circSfl), which is consistently upregulated, particularly in the brain and muscle, of diverse long-lived insulin mutants. Strikingly, lifespan extension of insulin mutants is dependent on circSfl, and overexpression of circSfl alone is sufficient to extend the lifespan. Moreover, circSfl is translated into a protein that shares the N terminus and potentially some functions with the full-length Sfl protein encoded by the host gene.

32601061,"Cysteamine dioxygenase (ADO) has been reported to exhibit two distinct biological functions with a nonheme iron center. It catalyzes oxidation of both cysteamine in sulfur metabolism and N-terminal cysteine-containing proteins or peptides, such as regulator of G protein signaling 5 (RGS5). It thereby preserves oxygen homeostasis in a variety of physiological processes. However, little is known about its catalytic center and how it interacts with these two types of primary substrates in addition to O2 Here, using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), Mössbauer, and UV-visible spectroscopies, we explored the binding mode of cysteamine and RGS5 to human and mouse ADO proteins in their physiologically relevant ferrous form. This characterization revealed that in the presence of nitric oxide as a spin probe and oxygen surrogate, both the small molecule and the peptide substrates coordinate the iron center with their free thiols in a monodentate binding mode, in sharp contrast to binding behaviors observed in other thiol dioxygenases. We observed a substrate-bound B-type dinitrosyl iron center complex in ADO, suggesting the possibility of dioxygen binding to the iron ion in a side-on mode. Moreover, we observed substrate-mediated reduction of the iron center from ferric to the ferrous oxidation state. Subsequent MS analysis indicated corresponding disulfide formation of the substrates, suggesting that the presence of the substrate could reactivate ADO to defend against oxidative stress.

32601062,"Pel is a GalNAc-rich bacterial polysaccharide that contributes to the structure and function of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms. The pelABCDEFG operon is highly conserved among diverse bacterial species, and Pel may therefore be a widespread biofilm determinant. Previous annotation of pel gene clusters has helped us identify an additional gene, pelX, that is present adjacent to pelABCDEFG in >100 different bacterial species. The pelX gene is predicted to encode a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) superfamily, but its potential role in Pel-dependent biofilm formation is unknown. Herein, we have used Pseudomonas protegens Pf-5 as a model to elucidate PelX function as Pseudomonas aeruginosa lacks a pelX homologue in its pel gene cluster. We found that P. protegens forms Pel-dependent biofilms; however, despite expression of pelX under these conditions, biofilm formation was unaffected in a ΔpelX strain. This observation led us to identify a pelX paralogue, PFL_5533, which we designate here PgnE, that appears to be functionally redundant to pelX In line with this, a ΔpelX ΔpgnE double mutant was substantially impaired in its ability to form Pel-dependent biofilms. To understand the molecular basis for this observation, we determined the structure of PelX to 2.1 Å resolution. The structure revealed that PelX resembles UDP-GlcNAc C4-epimerases. Using 1H NMR analysis, we show that PelX catalyzes the epimerization between UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GalNAc. Our results indicate that Pel-dependent biofilm formation requires a UDP-GlcNAc C4-epimerase that generates the UDP-GalNAc precursors required by the Pel synthase machinery for polymer production.",0,0.0,{}
32601371,"Following fertilization in mammals, the gametes are reprogrammed to create a totipotent zygote, a process that involves de novo establishment of chromatin domains. A major feature occurring during preimplantation development is the dramatic remodelling of constitutive heterochromatin, although the functional relevance of this is unknown. Here, we show that heterochromatin establishment relies on the stepwise expression and regulated activity of SUV39H enzymes. Enforcing precocious acquisition of constitutive heterochromatin results in compromised development and epigenetic reprogramming, which demonstrates that heterochromatin remodelling is essential for natural reprogramming at fertilization. We find that de novo H3K9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) in the paternal pronucleus after fertilization is catalysed by SUV39H2 and that pericentromeric RNAs inhibit SUV39H2 activity and reduce H3K9me3. De novo H3K9me3 is initially non-repressive for gene expression, but instead bookmarks promoters for compaction. Overall, we uncover the functional importance for the restricted transmission of constitutive heterochromatin during reprogramming and a non-repressive role for H3K9me3.",0,0.0,{}

Here we use a combination of live microscopy and electron tomography, as well as computer simulations, to uncover the mechanism underlying micronuclear collapse. We show that, due to their small size, micronuclei inherently lack the capacity of primary nuclei to restrict the accumulation of CHMP7-LEMD2, a compartmentalization sensor that detects loss of nuclear integrity. This causes unrestrained ESCRT-III accumulation, which drives extensive membrane deformation, DNA damage and chromosome fragmentation.

Unbiased detection through proximity labeling of transient protein interactions in cell-free Xenopus laevis egg extract identified the dimeric histone chaperone facilitates chromatin transcription (FACT) as an interactor of substrate-bound Cas9. FACT is both necessary and sufficient to displace dCas9, and FACT immunodepletion converts Cas9's activity from multi-turnover to single turnover. In human cells, FACT depletion extends dCas9 residence times, delays genome editing, and alters the balance between indel formation and homology-directed repair.

The pathogenicity and establishment of S. aureus infections are tightly linked to its ability to modulate host immunity. Persistent infections are often associated with mutant staphylococcal strains that have decreased susceptibility to antibiotics; however, little is known about how these mutations influence bacterial interaction with the host immune system. Here, we discovered that clinical S. aureus isolates activate human monocytes, leading to cell-surface expression of immune stimulatory natural killer group 2D (NKG2D) ligands on the monocytes. We found that expression of the NKG2D ligand ULBP2 (UL16-binding protein 2) is associated with bacterial degradability and phagolysosomal activity. Moreover, S. aureus-induced ULBP2 expression was linked to altered host cell metabolism, including increased cytoplasmic (iso)citrate levels, reduced glycolytic flux, and functional mitochondrial activity. Interestingly, we found that the ability of S. aureus to induce ULBP2 and proinflammatory cytokines in human monocytes depends on a functional ClpP protease in S. aureus These findings indicate that S. aureus activates ULBP2 in human monocytes through immunometabolic mechanisms and reveal that clpP inactivation may function as a potential immune evasion mechanism. Our results provide critical insight into the interplay between the host immune system and S. aureus that has evolved under the dual selective pressure of host immune responses and antibiotic treatment.

Pancreas and blood were collected for molecular analyses, and clonal MIN6 β-cells and primary islets from HFD-induced obese mice and normal chow diet-fed mice were used in additional analyses. In vivo, MPE both increased insulin secretion and reduced blood glucose in the db/db mice but increased only insulin secretion in the HFD-induced obese mice. MPE substantially increased the β-cell area in both models (3-fold and 2-fold, p < 0.01, for db/db and HFD mice, respectively). We observed reduced nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit of NF-κB in islets of MPE-treated db/db mice, coinciding with enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). In vitro, MPE potentiated GSIS and decreased interleukin 1β (IL-1β) secretion in MIN6 β-cells. Incubation of MIN6 cells with tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), interferon-γ, and IL-1β amplified IL-1β secretion and inhibited GSIS. These effects were partially reversed with MPE or the IκB kinase β inhibitor PS1145, coinciding with reduced activation of p65 and p-IκB in the NF-κB pathway.

Furthermore, optogenetic control of cofilin nuclear localization reveals the dynamically regulated F-actin nucleoskeleton in zygotes, and its timely disassembly is needed for developmental progression. Nuclear F-actin is a hallmark of totipotent zygotic PN, and the temporal regulation of its polymerized state is necessary for normal embryonic development.",0,0.0,{}
32610126,"Activated macrophages must carefully calibrate their inflammatory responses to balance efficient pathogen control with inflammation-mediated tissue damage, but the molecular underpinnings of this ""balancing act"" remain unclear. Using genetically engineered mouse models and primary macrophage cultures, we show that Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling induces the expression of the transcription factor Spic selectively in patrolling monocytes and tissue macrophages by a nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)-dependent mechanism. Functionally, Spic downregulates pro-inflammatory cytokines and promotes iron efflux by regulating ferroportin expression in activated macrophages. Notably, interferon-gamma blocks Spic expression in a STAT1-dependent manner. High levels of interferon-gamma are indicative of ongoing infection, and in its absence, activated macrophages appear to engage a ""default"" Spic-dependent anti-inflammatory pathway. We also provide evidence for the engagement of this pathway in sterile inflammation. Taken together, our findings uncover a pathway wherein counter-regulation of Spic by NF-κB and STATs attune inflammatory responses and iron metabolism in macrophages.",1,3.0,"{""Inhibition"": 1}"

Mice overexpressing Fosl2 (Fosl2tg) indeed show a systemic inflammatory phenotype, with immune infiltrates in multiple organs. This phenotype is absent in Fosl2tg × Rag2-/- mice lacking T and B cells, and Fosl2 induces T cell-intrinsic reduction of Treg development that is responsible for the inflammatory phenotype. Fosl2tg T cells can transfer inflammation, which is suppressed by the co-delivery of Tregs, while Fosl2 deficiency in T cells reduces the severity of autoimmunity in the EAE model.

Here, we studied the role of the LMVEC-derived bioactive lipid sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) in promoting alveolar repair using mice with endothelial-specific deletion of sphingosine kinase 1 (Sphk1), the key enzyme promoting S1P generation. These mutant lungs developed airspace-enlargement lesions and exhibited a reduced number of AT1 cells after Pseudomonas-aeruginosa-induced lung injury. We demonstrated that S1P released by LMVECs acted via its receptor, S1PR2, on AT2 cells and induced nuclear translocation of yes-associated protein (YAP), a regulator of AT2 to AT1 transition.

To understand what input shapes the opposing MSN activities, here, we monitor cortical input activities at the cell population level and artificially reverse them. We demonstrate that the ventral hippocampus (vHP) and the insular cortex (IC) are major inputs to the VMS and VLS, both projections show silencing at the trial start time, and the vHP-VMS and IC-VLS pathways form functionally coupled input-output units during the task. Of note, the upstream IC silencing is converted to the downstream VLS-MSN activation.

Interestingly, we identify treatment-induced senescence as a previously unrecognized determinant of cfDNA kinetics that can counteract its release. Necrosis is the predominant cell death mechanism that consistently contributes to cfDNA release in response to ionizing radiation, and, surprisingly, apoptosis plays a comparatively minor role in some tumors.

In mouse models of either contusive spinal cord injury or transient ischemic stroke, the conditional knockout of Zeb2 in astrocytes attenuates astrogliosis, generates larger lesions, and delays the recovery of motor function.

In organotypic slice cultures derived from mice with a knock-in mutation in the APP gene (APP D664A) to inhibit caspase cleavage, Aβ-induced synaptic injury is markedly reduced in two models of Aβ toxicity. Loss of dendritic spines is also attenuated in mice treated with caspase inhibitors.

The structure is intrinsically disordered and therefore remains poorly characterized. Findings of previous studies are consistent with the Nterm domain undergoing a conformational transition to an ordered structure upon nucleic acid binding. In this study, we used NMR to investigate how the type of RNA, as well as the presence of the adjacent anticodon-binding domain (ACB), influences the Nterm conformation. To explore the latter, we used sortase A ligation to produce a segmentally labeled tandem-domain protein, Nterm-ACB. In the absence of RNA, Nterm remained disordered regardless of ACB attachment.

The central region of the Nterm domain adopted α-helical structure upon titration of Nterm and Nterm-ACB with RNA hairpins containing double-stranded regions. Nterm binding to the RNA hairpins resulted in CD spectral shifts consistent with an induced helical structure. NMR and fluorescence anisotropy revealed that Nterm binding to hairpin RNAs is weak but that the binding affinity increases significantly upon covalent attachment to ACB.

Phosphorylated METTL3 is then localized to DNA damage sites, where it methylates the N6 position of adenosine (m6A) in DNA damage-associated RNAs, which recruits the m6A reader protein YTHDC1 for protection. In this way, the METTL3-m6A-YTHDC1 axis modulates accumulation of DNA-RNA hybrids at DSBs sites, which then recruit RAD51 and BRCA1 for homologous recombination (HR)-mediated repair. METTL3-deficient cells display defective HR, accumulation of unrepaired DSBs, and genome instability. Accordingly, depletion of METTL3 significantly enhances the sensitivity of cancer cells and murine xenografts to DNA damage-based therapy. These findings uncover the function of METTL3 and YTHDC1 in HR-mediated DSB repair, which may have implications for cancer therapy.",1,1.5,"{""Activation"": 1}"

However, it is unclear whether this system distinguishes collision complexes formed on defective mRNAs from those with functional roles on endogenous transcripts. Here, we performed disome and trisome footprint profiling in yeast and found collisions were enriched on diverse sequence motifs known to slow translation. When 60S recycling was inhibited, disomes accumulated at stop codons and could move into the 3' UTR to reinitiate translation. The ubiquitin ligase and RQC factor Hel2/ZNF598 generally recognized collisions but did not induce degradation of endogenous transcripts. However, loss of Hel2 triggered the integrated stress response, via phosphorylation of eIF2α, thus linking these pathways.

Here, we reveal rhythmic genome-wide alternative splicing (AS) of pre-mRNAs encoding regulators of peptidergic secretion within pancreatic β cells that are perturbed in Clock-/- and Bmal1-/- β-cell lines. We show that the RNA-binding protein THRAP3 (thyroid hormone receptor-associated protein 3) regulates circadian clock-dependent AS by binding to exons at coding sequences flanking exons that are more frequently skipped in clock mutant β cells, including transcripts encoding Cask (calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase) and Madd (MAP kinase-activating death domain). Depletion of THRAP3 restores expression of the long isoforms of Cask and Madd, and mimicking exon skipping in these transcripts through antisense oligonucleotide delivery in wild-type islets reduces glucose-stimulated insulin secretion.

Furthermore, we show that NBAS fulfills an independent function in NMD. This ER-NMD pathway requires the interaction of NBAS with the core NMD factor UPF1, which is partially localized at the ER in the proximity of the translocon. NBAS and UPF1 coregulate the stability of ER-associated transcripts, in particular those associated with the cellular stress response.

We identified biologically important genes, such as Angpt1, Tgfb2, Tgfb3, Itga8, and Itgb7, whose transcription is regulated by Ambra1-scaffolded complexes, likely by altering histone modifications and Atf2 activity. Therefore, in addition to its recognized roles in autophagy and trafficking, Ambra1 scaffolds protein complexes at chromatin, regulating transcriptional signaling in the nucleus.

In this study, we investigated GA's effects on Aβ oligomer formation and deposition. Specifically, we compared them with those of other vitamin E analogs and the soy isoflavone genistein, a natural agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) that has therapeutic potential for managing AD. GA significantly reduced Aβ aggregation and accumulation in mouse cortical astrocytes. Similarly to genistein, GA up-regulated PPARγ expression and apolipoprotein E (ApoE) efflux in these cells with an efficacy that was comparable with that of its metabolic precursor δ-tocotrienol and higher than those of α-tocopherol metabolites. Unlike for genistein and the other vitamin E compounds, the GA-induced restoration of ApoE efflux was not affected by pharmacological inhibition of PPARγ activity, and specific activation of pregnane X receptor (PXR) was observed together with ApoE and multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1) membrane transporter up-regulation in both the mouse astrocytes and brain tissue. These effects of GA were associated with reduced Aβ deposition in the brain of TgCRND8 mice, a transgenic AD model. In conclusion, GA holds potential for preventing Aβ oligomerization and deposition in the brain.

We found that DIMT1+/- heterozygous HEK 293T cells have a significantly decreased 40S fraction and reduced protein synthesis but no major changes in m26,6A levels in 18S rRNA. Expression of a catalytically inactive variant, DIMT1-E85A, in WT and DIMT1+/- cells significantly decreased m26,6A levels in 18S rRNA, indicating a dominant-negative effect of this variant on m26,6A levels. However, expression of the DIMT1-E85A variant restored the defects in 40S levels. Of note, unlike WT DIMT1, DIMT1-E85A could not revert the defects in protein translation. We found that the differences between this variant and the WT enzyme extended to translation fidelity and gene expression patterns in DNA damage response pathways.

We noted that a continuous supply of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-retained VEGFR-2 to the plasma membrane is required to maintain VEGFR-2 at the cell surface. siRNA-mediated NOX4 silencing decreased the ER-retained form of VEGFR-2, resulting in decreased cell surface expression levels of the receptor. We also found that ER-localized NOX4 interacts with ER-retained VEGFR-2 and thereby stabilizes this ER-retained form at the protein level in the ER.

However, the precise molecular mechanisms that regulate the synaptic targeting of these receptors are unclear. Whereas it has been previously shown that phosphorylation events in α4, β, and γ subunits of GABAARs govern their function and trafficking, phosphorylation of other subunits has not yet been demonstrated. Here, we show that the α2 subunit of GABAARs is phosphorylated at Ser-359 and enables dynamic regulation of GABAAR binding to the scaffolding proteins gephyrin and collybistin. We initially identified Ser-359 phosphorylation by MS analysis, and additional experiments revealed that it is regulated by the activities of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and the protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and/or PP2A. GST-based pulldowns and coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate preferential binding of both gephyrin and collybistin to WT and an S359A phosphonull variant, but not to an S359D phosphomimetic variant. Furthermore, the decreased capacity of the α2 S359D variant to bind collybistin and gephyrin decreased the density of synaptic α2-containing GABAAR clusters and caused an absence of α2 enrichment in the axon initial segment. These results suggest that PKA-mediated phosphorylation and PP1/PP2A-dependent dephosphorylation of the α2 subunit play a role in the dynamic regulation of GABAAR accumulation at inhibitory synapses, thereby regulating the strength of synaptic inhibition.

Studies using IRS-2 knockout (KO) mice showed that the deletion of IRS-2 causes type 2 diabetes due to peripheral insulin resistance and impaired β-cell function. However, little is known about the roles of IRS-2 in other animal models. Here, we created IRS-2 KO rats to elucidate the physiological functions of IRS-2 in rats.

Besides the modestly increased insulin sensitivity, male IRS-2 KO rats displayed the enhanced insulin-induced activation of the mTOR complex 1 pathway in the liver compared with WT rats.

However, the role of FOXC1 in CHD, and how these mutations might impact FOXC1 function, remains elusive. Our previous work provided one clue to possible function, demonstrating that zebrafish foxc1a, an orthologue of human FOXC1 essential for heart development, directly regulates the expression of nkx2.5, encoding a transcriptional regulator of cardiac progenitor cells. Abnormal expression of Nkx2-5 leads to CHD in mice and is also associated with CHD patients. Whether this link extends to the human system, however, requires investigation.

A comparison of FOXC1 mutant function in the rat cardiac cell line H9c2 and zebrafish embryos suggested that the zebrafish embryos might serve as a more representative model system than the H9c2 cells.

Among these, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is secreted by various cell types residing in the TME and promotes tumor progression by inducing the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of cancer cells and tumor angiogenesis. TGF-β comprises three isoforms, TGF-β1, -β2, and -β3, and transduces intracellular signals via TGF-β type I receptor (TβRI) and TGF-β type II receptor (TβRII). For the purpose of designing ligand traps that reduce oncogenic signaling in the TME, chimeric proteins comprising the ligand-interacting ectodomains of receptors fused with the Fc portion of immunoglobulin are often used. For example, chimeric soluble TβRII (TβRII-Fc) has been developed as an effective therapeutic strategy for targeting TGF-β ligands, but several lines of evidence indicate that TβRII-Fc more effectively traps TGF-β1 and TGF-β3 than TGF-β2, whose expression is elevated in multiple cancer types. In the present study, we developed a chimeric TGF-β receptor containing both TβRI and TβRII (TβRI-TβRII-Fc) and found that TβRI-TβRII-Fc trapped all TGF-β isoforms, leading to inhibition of both the TGF-β signal and TGF-β-induced EMT of oral cancer cells, whereas TβRII-Fc failed to trap TGF-β2. Furthermore, we found that TβRI-TβRII-Fc suppresses tumor growth and angiogenesis more effectively than TβRII-Fc in a subcutaneous xenograft model of oral cancer cells with high TGF-β expression.

Previous studies in the yeast model have indicated that CL is required for optimal iron homeostasis, which is disrupted by a mechanism not yet determined in the yeast CL mutant, crd1Δ. This finding has implications for the severe genetic disorder, Barth syndrome (BTHS), in which CL metabolism is perturbed because of mutations in the CL-remodeling enzyme, tafazzin. Here, we investigate the effects of tafazzin deficiency on iron homeostasis in the mouse myoblast model of BTHS tafazzin knockout (TAZ-KO) cells. Similarly to CL-deficient yeast cells, TAZ-KO cells exhibited elevated sensitivity to iron, as well as to H2O2, which was alleviated by the iron chelator deferoxamine. TAZ-KO cells exhibited increased expression of the iron exporter ferroportin and decreased expression of the iron importer transferrin receptor, likely reflecting a regulatory response to elevated mitochondrial iron. Reduced activities of mitochondrial iron-sulfur cluster enzymes suggested that the mechanism underlying perturbation of iron homeostasis was defective iron-sulfur biogenesis. We observed decreased levels of Yfh1/frataxin, an essential component of the iron-sulfur biogenesis machinery, in mitochondria from TAZ-KO mouse cells and in CL-deleted yeast crd1Δ cells, indicating that the role of CL in iron-sulfur biogenesis is highly conserved.

ANKS4B is known to be an essential scaffold within the IMAC, although its functional properties have not been thoroughly characterized. We report here that ANKS4B is directed to the brush border using a noncanonical apical targeting sequence that maps to a previously unannotated region of the scaffold.

Sequence analysis revealed a coiled-coil motif and a putative membrane-binding basic-hydrophobic repeat sequence within this targeting region, both of which were required for the scaffold to target and mediate brush border assembly. Size-exclusion chromatography of the isolated targeting sequence coupled with in vitro brush border binding assays suggests that it functions as an oligomer. We further show that the corresponding sequence found in the closest homolog of ANKS4B, the scaffold USH1G that operates in sensory epithelia as part of the Usher complex, lacks the inherent ability to target to microvilli.

Extensive isothermal titration calorimetry experiments reveal that the lectin was sensitive to the length and branching of mannooligosaccharides and thereby the total valency. Modeling and simulation studies demonstrate two distinct modes of binding, a monovalent binding to shorter saccharides and a bivalent mode for higher glycans, involving simultaneous interactions of multiple glycan arms with the primary carbohydrate-binding sites. This multivalent mode of binding was further strengthened by interactions of core mannosyl residues with a secondary conserved site on the protein, leading to an exponential increase in affinity.

The bile acid 3-keto petromyzonol sulfate (3kPZS) is a major component of the sex pheromone mixture from male sea lamprey that induces specific olfactory and behavioral responses in conspecific individuals. Olfactory receptors interact directly with pheromones, which is the first step in their detection, but identifying the cognate receptors of specific pheromones is often challenging. Here, we deorphanized two highly related odorant receptors (ORs), OR320a and OR320b, of P. marinus that respond to 3kPZS. In a heterologous expression system coupled to a cAMP-responsive CRE-luciferase, OR320a and OR320b specifically responded to C24 5α-bile acids, and both receptors were activated by the same set of 3kPZS analogs. OR320a displayed larger responses to all 3kPZS analogs than did OR320b. This difference appeared to be largely determined by a single amino acid residue, Cys-792.56, the C-terminal sixth residue relative to the most conserved residue in the second transmembrane domain (2.56) of OR320a. This region of TM2 residues 2.56-2.60 apparently is critical for the detection of steroid compounds by odorant receptors in lamprey, zebrafish, and humans.

However, the proline residue of DYRK1 targeted by hydroxylation and the role of prolyl hydroxylation in tyrosine autophosphorylation of DYRK1 are unknown. We found that a highly conserved proline in the CMGC insert of the DYRK1 kinase domain is hydroxylated by PHD1, and this event precedes tyrosine autophosphorylation. Mutation of the hydroxylation acceptor proline precludes tyrosine autophosphorylation and folding of DYRK1, resulting in a kinase unable to preserve VHL function and lacking glioma suppression activity. The consensus proline sequence is shared by most CMGC kinases, and prolyl hydroxylation is essential for catalytic activation. Thus, formation of prolyl-hydroxylated intermediates is a novel mechanism of kinase maturation and likely a general mechanism of regulation of CMGC kinases in eukaryotes.",0,0.0,{}
32640214,"Mutant p53 (mutp53) loses its tumor suppressor properties but gains oncogenic functions of driving malignancy. However, it remains largely unknown how mutp53 drives cancer metastasis. Here, we show that wild-type p53 (WTp53) suppresses the secretion of heat shock protein 90-alpha (Hsp90α), whereas mutp53 enhances Hsp90α vesicular trafficking and exosome-mediated secretion. Long-term delivery of an antibody that blocks extracellular Hsp90α (eHsp90α) function extends the survival of p53-/- mice and attenuates the invasiveness of p53 mutant tumors. Furthermore, mass spectrometry and functional analysis identified a critical role for Rab coupling protein (RCP) in mutp53-induced Hsp90α secretion. RCP knockdown decreases eHsp90α levels and inhibits malignant progression. Notably, recombinant Hsp90α re-introduction markedly rescues the impaired migration and invasion abilities caused by RCP depletion. Taken together, these findings elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which mutp53 executes oncogenic activities via its downstream RCP-mediated Hsp90α secretion and a strategy to treat human cancers expressing mutp53 proteins.",8,4.5,"{""Inhibition"": 2, ""IncreaseAmount"": 2, ""Activation"": 2, ""DecreaseAmount"": 2}"

We find that stable intermediate levels of fractional killing are uncommon, with many drug treatments resulting in complete or near-complete eradication of all cells, if given enough time. The kinetics of fractional killing over time vary substantially as a function of drug, drug dose, and genetic background. At the molecular level, the antiapoptotic protein MCL1 is an important determinant of the kinetics of fractional killing in response to MAPK pathway inhibitors but not other lethal stimuli. These studies suggest that fractional killing is governed by diverse lethal stimulus-specific mechanisms.",0,0.0,{}
32640216,"The ability of pancreatic β-cells to respond to increased demands for insulin during metabolic stress critically depends on proper ribosome homeostasis and function. Excessive and long-lasting stimulation of insulin secretion can elicit endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, unfolded protein response, and β-cell apoptosis. Here we show that the diabetes susceptibility gene JAZF1 is a key transcriptional regulator of ribosome biogenesis, global protein, and insulin translation. JAZF1 is excluded from the nucleus, and its expression levels are reduced upon metabolic stress and in diabetes. Genetic deletion of Jazf1 results in global impairment of protein synthesis that is mediated by defects in ribosomal protein synthesis, ribosomal RNA processing, and aminoacyl-synthetase expression, thereby inducing ER stress and increasing β-cell susceptibility to apoptosis. Importantly, JAZF1 function and its pleiotropic actions are impaired in islets of murine T2D and in human islets exposed to metabolic stress.

Aiming to gain mechanistic insight into the link between inflammation and CRC, we perform transcriptomics analysis of human CRC, identifying a strong correlation between expression of the serine protease granzyme A (GzmA) and inflammation. In a dextran sodium sulfate and azoxymethane (DSS/AOM) mouse model, deficiency and pharmacological inhibition of extracellular GzmA both attenuate gut inflammation and prevent CRC development, including the initial steps of cell transformation and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Mechanistically, extracellular GzmA induces NF-κB-dependent IL-6 production in macrophages, which in turn promotes STAT3 activation in cultured CRC cells. Accordingly, colon tissues from DSS/AOM-treated, GzmA-deficient animals present reduced levels of pSTAT3. By identifying GzmA as a proinflammatory protease that promotes CRC development, these findings provide information on mechanisms that link immune cell infiltration to cancer progression and present GzmA as a therapeutic target for CRC.",1,1.5,"{""Activation"": 1}"

However, for a significant number of patients, these therapies have proven ineffective. Growing evidence shows that the metabolic requirements of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) greatly influence the success of immunotherapy. It is well established that the TME influences energy consumption and metabolic reprogramming of immune cells, often inducing them to become tolerogenic and inefficient in cancer cell eradication. Increasing nutrient availability using pharmacological modulators of metabolism or antibodies targeting specific immune receptors are strategies that support energetic rewiring of immune cells and boost their anti-tumor capacity. In this review, we describe the metabolic features of the diverse immune cell types in the context of the TME and discuss how these immunomodulatory strategies could synergize with immunotherapy to circumvent its current limitations.",0,0.0,{}

In this study, we report that ZGRF1 null cells accumulate chromosome aberrations following replication perturbation and show sensitivity to two potent replication-blocking anticancer drugs: mitomycin C and camptothecin. Moreover, ZGRF1 null cells are defective in catalyzing DNA damage-induced sister chromatid exchange despite accumulating excessive FANCD2, RAD51, and γ-H2AX foci upon induction of interstrand DNA crosslinks. Consistent with a direct role in promoting recombinational DNA repair, we show that ZGRF1 is a 5'-to-3' helicase that catalyzes D-loop dissociation and Holliday junction branch migration. Moreover, ZGRF1 physically interacts with RAD51 and stimulates strand exchange catalyzed by RAD51-RAD54. On the basis of these data, we propose that ZGRF1 promotes repair of replication-blocking DNA lesions through stimulation of homologous recombination.",0,0.0,{}

Using live-cell imaging, we show that WRNIP1 is recruited to ICLs quickly after their appearance, promoting repair. The observed recruitment facilitates subsequent recruitment of the FANCD2/FANCI complex. Depletion of WRNIP1 sensitizes cells to ICL-forming drugs. We find that ubiquitination of WRNIP1 and the activity of its UBZ domain are required to facilitate recruitment of FANCD2/FANCI and promote repair. Altogether, we describe a mechanism by which WRNIP1 is recruited rapidly to ICLs, resulting in chromatin loading of the FANCD2/FANCI complex in an unusual process entailing ubiquitination of WRNIP1 and the activity of its integral UBZ domain.",3,9.0,"{""Complex"": 3}"

Using the MCMV model of infection, we find that, in contrast to liver cNK cells, trNK cells initially undergo a contraction phase followed by a recovery phase to homeostatic levels. The contraction is MCMV independent because a similar phenotype is observed following poly(I:C)/CpG or α-GalCer injection. The rapid contraction phase is due to apoptosis, whereas the recovery phase occurs via proliferation in situ. Interestingly, trNK cell apoptosis is not mediated by fratricide and not induced by liver lymphocytes or inflammatory cytokines. Instead, we find that trNK cell apoptosis is the consequence of an increased sensitivity to lactic acid. Mechanistic analysis indicates that trNK cell sensitivity to lactate is linked to impaired mitochondrial function.

32640222,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with social and communicative disabilities. The cellular and circuit mechanisms by which loss of neurofibromin 1 (Nf1) results in social deficits are unknown. Here, we identify social behavioral dysregulation with Nf1 loss in Drosophila. These deficits map to primary dysfunction of a group of peripheral sensory neurons. Nf1 regulation of Ras signaling in adult ppk23+ chemosensory cells is required for normal social behaviors in flies. Loss of Nf1 attenuates ppk23+ neuronal activity in response to pheromones, and circuit-specific manipulation of Nf1 expression or neuronal activity in ppk23+ neurons rescues social deficits. This disrupted sensory processing gives rise to persistent changes in behavior beyond the social interaction, indicating a sustained effect of an acute sensory misperception. Together our data identify a specific circuit mechanism through which Nf1 regulates social behaviors and suggest social deficits in NF1 arise from propagation of sensory misinformation.",0,0.0,{}
32640223,"Macrophages play a central role in intestinal immunity, but inappropriate macrophage activation is associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Here, we identify granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) as a critical regulator of intestinal macrophage activation in patients with IBD and mice with dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis. We find that GM-CSF drives the maturation and polarization of inflammatory intestinal macrophages, promoting anti-microbial functions while suppressing wound-healing transcriptional programs. Group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) are a major source of GM-CSF in intestinal inflammation, with a strong positive correlation observed between ILC or CSF2 transcripts and M1 macrophage signatures in IBD mucosal biopsies. Furthermore, GM-CSF-dependent macrophage polarization results in a positive feedback loop that augmented ILC3 activation and type 17 immunity.

Using an epitope-tagged Cntd1 allele, we detect a short isoform of CNTD1 in vivo that lacks a predicted N-terminal cyclin domain and does not bind cyclin-dependent kinases. Instead, we find that the short-form CNTD1 variant associates with components of the replication factor C (RFC) machinery to facilitate crossover formation, and with the E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme, CDC34, to regulate ubiquitylation and subsequent degradation of the WEE1 kinase, thereby modulating cell-cycle progression. We propose that these interactions facilitate a role for CNTD1 as a stop-go regulator during prophase I, ensuring accurate and complete crossover formation before allowing metaphase progression and the first meiotic division.",0,0.0,{}

Mechanistic information on VP biogenesis has so far been difficult to attain due to the necessity of studying their formation under conditions of viral replication, where perturbations reducing replication will inevitably impact VP formation. Here, we report a replication-independent expression system, designated pIRO (plasmid-induced replication organelle formation) that induces bona fide DENV and ZIKV VPs that are morphologically indistinguishable from those in infected cells. Using this system, we demonstrate that sequences in the 3' terminal RNA region of the DENV, but not the ZIKV genome, contribute to VP formation in a non-replicative manner.

Recent studies provide substantial evidence for MAP4K family kinases in the Hippo pathway regulation, suggesting a broad role of MAP4Ks in human physiology and diseases. However, a comprehensive analysis of the regulators and effectors for this key kinase family has not been fully achieved. Using a proteomic approach, we define the protein-protein interaction network for human MAP4K family kinases and reveal diverse cellular signaling events involving this important kinase family. Through it, we identify a STRIPAK complex component, STRN4, as a generic binding partner for MAP4Ks and a key regulator of the Hippo pathway in endometrial cancer development.

We find that reversal of aberrant astrocytic GABA synthesis, by pharmacological inhibition and astrocyte-specific gene silencing of MAO-B, reverses the reduction in cortical glucose metabolism. Moreover, induction of aberrant astrocytic GABA synthesis by cortical injection of putrescine or adenovirus recapitulates cortical hypometabolism. Furthermore, MAO-B inhibition causes a remarkable recovery from post-stroke motor deficits when combined with a rehabilitation regimen. Collectively, our data indicate that cortical glucose hypometabolism in subcortical stroke is caused by aberrant astrocytic GABA and MAO-B inhibition and that attenuating cortical hypometabolism can be a therapeutic approach in subcortical stroke.",5,1.5,"{""Inhibition"": 1, ""Activation"": 4}"

In addition, we show that nog2 expression in the notochord is induced by at least one notochord enhancer and its loss of function reduces the number of pancreatic progenitors and impairs β cell differentiation. Tracing Nog2 diffusion, we show that Nog2 emanates from the notochord to the pancreas progenitor domain. Finally, we find a notochord enhancer in human and mice Nog genomic landscapes, suggesting that the acquisition of a Nog notochord enhancer occurred early in the vertebrate phylogeny and contributes to the development of complex organs like the pancreas.",0,0.0,{}

Strikingly, we find that in mice lacking Shank2, an autism spectrum disorder (ASD)-linked gene encoding an excitatory postsynaptic scaffold protein, the learning-induced over-representation of landmarks was absent whereas the over-representation of rewards was substantially increased, as was goal-directed behavior. These findings demonstrate that multiple hippocampal coding processes for unique types of salient features are distinguished by a Shank2-dependent mechanism and suggest that abnormally distorted hippocampal salience mapping may underlie cognitive and behavioral abnormalities in a subset of ASDs.",0,0.0,{}
32640230,"Chronic exposure to stress is a major risk factor for neuropsychiatric disease, and elevated plasma corticosterone (CORT) correlates with reduced levels of both brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and hippocampal neurogenesis. Precisely how these phenomena are linked, however, remains unclear. Using a cortico-hippocampal network-on-a-chip, we find that the glucocorticoid receptor agonist dexamethasone (DXM) stimulates the cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) to phosphorylate huntingtin (HTT) at serines 1181 and 1201 (S1181/1201), which retards BDNF vesicular transport in cortical axons. Parallel studies in mice show that CORT induces phosphorylation of these same residues, reduces BDNF levels, and suppresses neurogenesis. The adverse effects of CORT are reduced in mice bearing an unphosphorylatable mutant HTT (HdhS1181A/S1201A). The protective effect of unphosphorylatable HTT, however, disappears if neurogenesis is blocked.

Using genetics, cell biology, and electrophysiology, we demonstrate that Neto-α functions on both sides of the NMJ. In muscle, Neto-α limits the size of the postsynaptic receptor field. In motor neurons (MNs), Neto-α controls neurotransmitter release in a KAR-dependent manner. In addition, Neto-α is both required and sufficient for the presynaptic increase in neurotransmitter release in response to reduced postsynaptic sensitivity. This KAR-independent function of Neto-α is involved in activity-induced cytomatrix remodeling.

32640232,"The cerebellum is involved in the control of voluntary and autonomic rhythmic behaviors, yet it is unclear to what extent it coordinates these in concert. We studied Purkinje cell activity during unperturbed and perturbed respiration in lobules simplex, crus 1, and crus 2. During unperturbed (eupneic) respiration, complex spike and simple spike activity encode the phase of ongoing sensorimotor processing. In contrast, when the respiratory cycle is perturbed by whisker stimulation, mice concomitantly protract their whiskers and advance their inspiration in a phase-dependent manner, preceded by increased simple spike activity. This phase advancement of respiration in response to whisker stimulation can be mimicked by optogenetic stimulation of Purkinje cells and prevented by cell-specific genetic modification of their AMPA receptors, hampering increased simple spike firing. Thus, the impact of Purkinje cell activity on respiratory control is context and phase dependent, highlighting a coordinating role for the cerebellar hemispheres in aligning autonomic and sensorimotor behaviors.",0,0.0,{}

Pyramidal cells (PCs) in the hippocampal CA3 are necessary for rapid memory encoding, which preferentially occurs during exploratory behavior in the high-arousal theta state. However, the relationship between the membrane potential dynamics of CA3 PCs and theta has not been explored. Here we characterize the changes in the membrane potential of PCs in relation to theta using electrophysiological recordings in awake mice. During theta, most PCs behave in a stereotypical manner, consistently hyperpolarizing time-locked to the duration of theta. Additionally, PCs display lower membrane potential variance and a reduced firing rate. In contrast, during large irregular activity, PCs show heterogeneous changes in membrane potential. This suggests coordinated hyperpolarization of PCs during theta, possibly caused by increased inhibition. This could lead to a higher signal-to-noise ratio in the small population of PCs active during theta, as observed in ensemble recordings.",0,0.0,{}

For the precise encoding of sound qualities, receptor potentials are shaped by K+ conductances tuning the properties of the IHC membrane. Using patch-clamp and computational modeling, we unravel this membrane specialization showing that IHCs express an exclusive repertoire of six voltage-dependent K+ conductances mediated by Kv1.8, Kv7.4, Kv11.1, Kv12.1, and BKCa channels. All channels are active at rest but are triggered differentially during sound stimulation. This enables non-saturating tuning over a far larger potential range than in IHCs expressing fewer current entities. Each conductance contributes to optimizing responses, but the combined activity of all channels synergistically improves phase locking and the dynamic range of intensities that IHCs can encode. Conversely, hypothetical simpler IHCs appear limited to encode only certain aspects (frequency or intensity). The exclusive channel repertoire of IHCs thus constitutes an evolutionary adaptation to encode complex sound through multifaceted receptor potentials.",4,6.0,"{""Activation"": 4}"

We confirm that a portion of R-loops formed co-transcriptionally at pluripotency genes in pluripotent stem cells and at lineage-controlling genes in differentiated lineages. Notably, a subset of R-loops maintained after differentiation are associated with repressive chromatin marks on silent pluripotency genes and undesired lineage genes. Moreover, in reprogrammed pluripotent cells, cell-of-origin-specific R-loops are initially present but are resolved with serial passaging.

For the wild-type suture, bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis identifies mesenchyme-, osteogenic front-, and stage-enriched genes and biological processes, as well as alternative splicing events modifying the extracellular matrix. Single-cell RNA-seq analysis distinguishes multiple subpopulations, of which five define a mesenchyme-osteoblast differentiation trajectory and show variation along the anteroposterior axis. Similar analyses of in vivo mouse models of impaired frontal suturogenesis in Saethre-Chotzen and Apert syndromes, Twist1+/- and Fgfr2+/S252W, demonstrate distinct transcriptional changes involving angiogenesis and ribogenesis, respectively.

Specifically, we discover a mucus secretory program induced by IL-13 in all cell types which converts both mucus and defense secretory cells into a metaplastic state with emergent mucin production and secretion, while leading to ER stress and cell death in ciliated cells. The IL-13-remodeled epithelium secretes a pathologic, mucin-imbalanced, and innate immunity-depleted proteome that arrests mucociliary motion.

We identify a proinflammatory F480+MHCII+Ly6Clo macrophage population that is associated with response rather than resistance to avelumab. These macrophages are the primary source of the interferon-inducible chemokine Cxcl9, which facilitates the recruitment of protective Cxcr3+ T cells. Consequently, the efficacy of avelumab in mouse tumor models is dependent on Cxcr3 and Cxcl9, and baseline levels of Cxcl9 in patients treated with avelumab are associated with clinical response and overall survival.

In mice, depletion of functional Tregs during late gestation induces preterm birth and adverse neonatal outcomes, which are rescued by the adoptive transfer of such cells. Treg depletion does not alter obstetrical parameters in the mother, yet it increases susceptibility to endotoxin-induced preterm birth.

Indeed, Vav3 is apically overexpressed in CF, associates with active β1 integrin luminally exposed, and increases fibronectin deposition. These luminal microdomains, rich in fibronectin and β1 integrin and regulated by Vav3, mediate the increased Pa adhesion to the CF epithelium. Interestingly, Vav3 inhibition normalizes the CF-dependent fibronectin and β1-integrin ectopic expression, improves the CF epithelial integrity, and prevents the enhanced Pa trapping to the CF epithelium.

For example, hepatitis C virus (HCV) causes a specific, large-fold increase in the steady-state abundance of intracellular desmosterol, an immediate precursor of cholesterol, resulting in increased fluidity of the membrane where HCV RNA replication occurs. Here, we establish the mechanism responsible for HCV's effect on intracellular desmosterol, whereby the HCV NS3-4A protease controls activity of 24-dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR24), the enzyme that catalyzes conversion of desmosterol to cholesterol. Our cumulative evidence for the proposed mechanism includes immunofluorescence microscopy experiments showing co-occurrence of DHCR24 and HCV NS3-4A protease; formation of an additional, faster-migrating DHCR24 species (DHCR24*) in cells harboring a HCV subgenomic replicon RNA or ectopically expressing NS3-4A; and biochemical evidence that NS3-4A cleaves DHCR24 to produce DHCR24* in vitro and in vivo We further demonstrate that NS3-4A cleaves DHCR24 between residues Cys91 and Thr92 and show that this reduces the intracellular conversion of desmosterol to cholesterol. Together, these studies demonstrate that NS3-4A directly cleaves DHCR24 and that this results in the enrichment of desmosterol in the membranes where NS3-4A and DHCR24 co-occur.

However, whether and how the activation mechanisms underlying EV treatment and Sox9+ cell-dependent regeneration intersect is unclear. We reasoned that a high-resolution imaging platform in living animals could help to untangle this system. To test this idea, we first applied EVs derived from human placenta-derived MSCs (hP-MSCs) to a Sox9-CreERT2; R26mTmG transgenic mouse model of acute kidney injury (AKI). Then, we developed an abdominal imaging window in the mouse and tracked the Sox9+ cells in the inducible Sox9-Cre transgenic mice via in vivo lineage tracing with two-photon intravital microscopy. Our results demonstrated that EVs can travel to the injured kidneys post intravenous injection as visualized by Gaussia luciferase imaging and markedly increase the activation of Sox9+ cells. Moreover, the two-photon living imaging of lineage-labeled Sox9+ cells showed that the EVs promoted the expansion of Sox9+ cells in kidneys post AKI. Histological staining results confirmed that the descendants of Sox9+ cells contributed to nephric tubule regeneration which significantly ameliorated the renal function after AKI. In summary, intravital lineage tracing with two-photon microscopy through an embedded abdominal imaging window provides a practical strategy to investigate the beneficial functions and to clarify the mechanisms of regenerative therapies in AKI.",0,0.0,{}

KChIP3 has been reported to also interact with the late endosomal/lysosomal membrane glycoprotein CLN3 (ceroid lipofuscinosis neuronal 3), which is modified because of gene mutation in juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (JNCL). The present study was undertaken to find out whether and how CLN3, by its interaction with KChIP3, may indirectly modulate Kv4.2 channel expression and function. To this end, we expressed KChIP3 and CLN3, either individually or simultaneously, together with Kv4.2 in HEK 293 cells. We performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments and found a lower amount of KChIP3 bound to Kv4.2 in the presence of CLN3. In whole-cell patch-clamp experiments, we examined the effects of CLN3 co-expression on the KChIP3-mediated modulation of Kv4.2 channels. Simultaneous co-expression of CLN3 and KChIP3 with Kv4.2 resulted in a suppression of the typical KChIP3-mediated modulation; i.e. we observed less increase in current density, less slowing of macroscopic current decay, less acceleration of recovery from inactivation, and a less positively shifted voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation. The suppression of the KChIP3-mediated modulation of Kv4.2 channels was weaker for the JNCL-related missense mutant CLN3R334C and for a JNCL-related C-terminal deletion mutant (CLN3ΔC).

Discovery of the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate provides an important link between metabolic dysfunction and cancer, unveiling the signaling function of metabolites in regulating epigenetic and epitranscriptomic modifications, genome integrity, and signal transduction. It is now known that cancer cells remodel their metabolic network to support biogenesis, caused by or resulting in the dysregulation of various metabolites. Cancer cells can sense alterations in metabolic intermediates to better coordinate multiple biological processes and enhance cell metabolism. Recent studies have demonstrated that metabolite signaling is involved in the regulation of malignant transformation, cell proliferation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, differentiation blockade, and cancer stemness. Additionally, intercellular metabolite signaling modulates inflammatory response and immunosurveillance in the tumor microenvironment. Here, we review recent advances in cancer-associated metabolite signaling.

They play a crucial role in setting the resting membrane potential and regulating cellular excitability. These channels form homodimers; however, a few examples of heterodimerization have also been reported. The K2P channel subunits TRESK and TREK-2 provide the predominant background potassium current in the primary sensory neurons of the dorsal root and trigeminal ganglia. A recent study has shown that a TRESK mutation causes migraine because it leads to the formation of a dominant negative truncated TRESK fragment. Surprisingly, this fragment can also interact with TREK-2. In this study, we determined the biophysical and pharmacological properties of the TRESK/TREK-2 heterodimer using a covalently linked TRESK/TREK-2 construct to ensure the assembly of the different subunits. The tandem channel has an intermediate single-channel conductance compared with the TRESK and TREK-2 homodimers. Similar conductance values were recorded when TRESK and TREK-2 were coexpressed, demonstrating that the two subunits can spontaneously form functional heterodimers. The TRESK component confers calcineurin-dependent regulation to the heterodimer and gives rise to a pharmacological profile similar to the TRESK homodimer, whereas the presence of the TREK-2 subunit renders the channel sensitive to the selective TREK-2 activator T2A3. In trigeminal primary sensory neurons, we detected single-channel activity with biophysical and pharmacological properties similar to the TRESK/TREK-2 tandem, indicating that WT TRESK and TREK-2 subunits coassemble to form functional heterodimeric channels also in native cells.",2,4.5,"{""Complex"": 1, ""Activation"": 1}"

Although the metabolic pathways generating eicosanoid-lysophospholipids have been increasingly appreciated, the signaling functions of eicosanoid-lysophospholipids remain largely unknown. Herein, we demonstrate that 2-12(S)-HETE-lysophospholipids as well as nonesterified 12(S)-HETE are potent lipid mediators that activate THP-1 human monocytic cells to generate tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and interleukin 8 (IL8). Remarkably, low nanomolar concentrations of 12(S)-HETE-lysophospholipids, but not other oxidized signaling lipids examined activated THP-1 cells resulting in the production of large amounts of TNFα. Moreover, TNFα release induced by 12(S)-HETE-lysophospholipids was inhibited by the TNFα converting enzyme inhibitor TAPI-0 indicating normal processing of TNFα in THP-1 cells stimulated with these agonists. Western blotting analyses revealed that 12(S)-HETE-lysophospholipids activated the phosphorylation of NFκB p65, suggesting activation of the canonical NFκB signaling pathway. Importantly, activation of THP-1 cells to release TNFα was stereoselective with 12(S)-HETE favored over 12(R)-HETE. Furthermore, the EC50 of 2-12(S)-HETE-lysophosphatidylcholine in activating THP-1 cells was 2.1 nm, whereas the EC50 of free 12(S)-HETE was 23 nm Additionally, lipid extracts of activated platelets were separated by RP-HPLC demonstrating the coelution of 12(S)-HETE with fractions initiating TNFα release. Collectively, these results demonstrate the potent signaling properties of 2-12(S)-HETE-lysophospholipids and 12(S)-HETE by their ability to release TNFα and activate NFκB signaling thereby revealing a previously unknown role of 2-12(S)-HETE-lysophospholipids in mediating inflammatory responses.",1,3.0,"{""DecreaseAmount"": 1}"

However, Cas12c (C2c3)- and Cas12d (CasY)-catalyzed DNA cleavage and genome editing activities have not been directly observed. We show here that a short-complementarity untranslated RNA (scoutRNA), together with crRNA, is required for Cas12d-catalyzed DNA cutting. The scoutRNA differs in secondary structure from previously described tracrRNAs used by CRISPR-Cas9 and some Cas12 enzymes, and in Cas12d-containing systems, scoutRNA includes a conserved five-nucleotide sequence that is essential for activity. In addition to supporting crRNA-directed DNA recognition, biochemical and cell-based experiments establish scoutRNA as an essential cofactor for Cas12c-catalyzed pre-crRNA maturation.

Unexpectedly, CN shows SLiM-dependent proximity to centrosomal and nuclear pore complex (NPC) proteins-structures where Ca2+ signaling is largely uncharacterized. CN dephosphorylates human and yeast NPC proteins and promotes accumulation of a nuclear transport reporter, suggesting conserved NPC regulation by CN.

How p97-extracted substrates are targeted to the proteasome with few or no ubiquitins is unknown. Here, we report that p97-extracted membrane proteins undergo a second round of ubiquitination catalyzed by the cytosolic ubiquitin ligase RNF126. RNF126 interacts with transmembrane-domain-specific chaperone BAG6, which captures p97-liberated substrates. RNF126 depletion in cells diminishes the ubiquitination of extracted membrane proteins, slows down their turnover, and dramatically stabilizes otherwise transient intermediates in the cytosol. We reconstitute the reubiquitination of a p97-extracted, misfolded multispanning membrane protein with purified factors.

Whereas the molecular machineries involved in membrane fusion/fission have been dissected, regulation of membrane dynamics remains poorly understood. The lysosomal vacuole of budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) has served as a seminal model in studies of membrane dynamics. We have previously established that yeast ENV7 encodes an ortholog of STK16-related kinases that localizes to the vacuolar membrane and downregulates vacuolar membrane fusion. Additionally, we have previously reported that Env7 phosphorylation in vivo depends on YCK3, a gene that encodes a vacuolar membrane casein kinase I (CKI) homolog that nonredundantly functions in fusion regulation. Here, we report that Env7 physically interacts with and is directly phosphorylated by Yck3. We also establish that Env7 vacuole fusion/fission regulation and vacuolar localization are mediated through its Yck3-dependent phosphorylation. Through extensive site-directed mutagenesis, we map phosphorylation to the Env7 C terminus and confirm that Ser-331 is a primary and preferred phosphorylation site. Phospho-deficient Env7 mutants were defective in negative regulation of membrane fusion, increasing the number of prominent vacuoles, whereas a phosphomimetic substitution at Ser-331 increased the number of fragmented vacuoles. Bioinformatics approaches confirmed that Env7 Ser-331 is within a motif that is highly conserved in STK16-related kinases and that it also anchors an SXXS CKI phosphorylation motif (328SRFS331).

CatA-mediated degradation of extracellular peptides may contribute to ECM remodeling and left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. Here, we aimed to evaluate the effects of CatA overexpression on LV remodeling. A proteomic analysis of the secretome of adult mouse cardiac fibroblasts upon digestion by CatA identified the extracellular antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase (EC-SOD) as a novel substrate of CatA, which decreased EC-SOD abundance 5-fold. In vitro, both cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts expressed and secreted CatA protein, and only cardiac fibroblasts expressed and secreted EC-SOD protein. Cardiomyocyte-specific CatA overexpression and increased CatA activity in the LV of transgenic mice (CatA-TG) reduced EC-SOD protein levels by 43%. Loss of EC-SOD-mediated antioxidative activity resulted in significant accumulation of superoxide radicals (WT, 4.54 μmol/mg tissue/min; CatA-TG, 8.62 μmol/mg tissue/min), increased inflammation, myocyte hypertrophy (WT, 19.8 μm; CatA-TG, 21.9 μm), cellular apoptosis, and elevated mRNA expression of hypertrophy-related and profibrotic marker genes, without affecting intracellular detoxifying proteins. In CatA-TG mice, LV interstitial fibrosis formation was enhanced by 19%, and the type I/type III collagen ratio was shifted toward higher abundance of collagen I fibers. Cardiac remodeling in CatA-TG was accompanied by an increased LV weight/body weight ratio and LV end diastolic volume (WT, 50.8 μl; CatA-TG, 61.9 μl).

However, although our understanding of glial biology is increasing, the signals that emanate from axons and regulate myelination remain largely unknown. To identify the core components of the myelination process, here we adopted a microarray analysis approach combined with laser-capture microdissection of spinal motoneurons during the myelinogenic phase of development. We identified neuronal genes whose expression was enriched during myelination and further investigated hepatoma-derived growth factor-related protein 3 (HRP3 or HDGFRP3). HRP3 was strongly expressed in the white matter fiber tracts of the peripheral (PNS) and central (CNS) nervous systems during myelination and remyelination in a cuprizone-induced demyelination model. The dynamic localization of HPR3 between axons and nuclei during myelination was consistent with its axonal localization during neuritogenesis. To study this phenomenon, we identified two splice variants encoded by the HRP3 gene: the canonical isoform HRP3-I and a newly recognized isoform, HRP3-II. HRP3-I remained solely in the nucleus, whereas HRP3-II displayed distinct axonal localization both before and during myelination. Interestingly, HRP3-II remained in the nuclei of unmyelinated neurons and glial cells, suggesting the existence of a molecular machinery that transfers it to and retains it in the axons of neurons fated for myelination. Overexpression of HRP3-II, but not of HRP3-I, increased Schwann cell numbers and myelination in PNS neuron-glia co-cultures.

The most common form of this disease (CMT1A, 1:4000) is associated with duplication of chromosome fragment 17p11.2-12, which results in a third WT PMP22 allele. In rodent models overexpressing the PMP22 (peripheral myelin protein 22) protein and in dermal fibroblasts from patients with CMT1A, PMP22 aggregates have been observed. This suggests that overexpression of PMP22 under CMT1A conditions overwhelms the endoplasmic reticulum quality control system, leading to formation of cytotoxic aggregates. In this work, we used a single-cell flow-cytometry trafficking assay to quantitatively examine the relationship between PMP22 expression and trafficking efficiency in individual cells. We observed that as expression of WT or disease variants of PMP22 is increased, the amount of intracellular PMP22 increases to a greater extent than the amount of surface-trafficked protein. This was true for both transiently transfected cells and PMP22 stable expressing cells.

The His-tag can also be directly detected by metal ion-loaded nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-based chelator heads conjugated to fluorophores, which is a convenient alternative method to immunoblotting. Typically, such chelator heads are conjugated to either green or red fluorophores, the detection of which requires specialized excitation sources and detection systems. Here, we demonstrate that post-run staining is ideal for His-tag detection by metal ion-loaded and fluorescently labeled chelator heads in PAGE and blot membranes. Additionally, by comparing the performances of different chelator heads, we show how differences in microscopic affinity constants translate to macroscopic differences in the detection limits in environments with limited diffusion, such as PAGE. On the basis of these results, we devise a simple approach, called UVHis-PAGE, that uses metal ion-loaded and fluorescently labeled chelator heads to detect His-tagged proteins in PAGE and blot membranes.

Characterization of the biophysics of binding of an ABD to albumin in solution could shed light on this question. Here, we examine the binding of an ABD to human serum albumin using isothermal titration calorimetry and assess the structural integrity of the ABD using CD, NMR, and molecular dynamics. A structure-activity analysis of truncations of the ABD suggests that downsized variants could replace the full-length domain. Reducing size could have the benefit of reducing potential immunogenicity problems. We further showed that one of these variants could be used to design a bifunctional molecule with affinity for albumin and a serum protein involved in cholesterol metabolism, PCSK9, demonstrating the potential utility of these fragments in the design of cholesterol-lowering drugs.

However, the mechanisms and molecular interactions used by pol β for substrate search and recognition are not clear. To provide insight into this process, a comparison was made of the DNA binding affinities of WT pol β, pol λ, and pol μ, and several variants of pol β, for 1-nt-gap-containing and undamaged DNA.

WT pol μ, lacking homologous lysines, displayed nonspecific DNA binding behavior similar to that of pol β KΔ3A, in line with previous data demonstrating both enzymes were deficient in processive searching. In fluorescent microscopy experiments using mouse fibroblasts deficient in PARP-1, the ability of pol β KΔ3A to localize to sites of laser-induced DNA damage was strongly decreased compared with that of WT pol β.

The Nte of FimA, which exhibits a pseudo-palindromic sequence, is inserted in an antiparallel orientation relative to the last β-strand of the preceding subunit in the pilus. The resulting subunit-subunit interactions are extraordinarily stable against dissociation and unfolding. Alternatively, FimA can fold to a self-complemented monomer with anti-apoptotic activity, in which the Nte inserts intramolecularly into the FimA core in the opposite, parallel orientation. The FimA monomers, however, show dramatically lower thermodynamic stability compared with FimA subunits in the assembled pilus. Using self-complemented FimA variants with reversed, pseudo-palindromic extensions, we demonstrate that the high stability of FimA polymers is primarily caused by the specific interactions between the side chains of the Nte residues and the FimA core and not by the antiparallel orientation of the donor strand alone.

However, a definitive demonstration of this interaction awaits, and insights into the structural basis and molecular mechanism remain unclear. Earlier studies have identified a Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3) domain present in Bcl-2 family members that engages receptors to stimulate apoptosis. We now show that Hsp70 physically interacts with pro-apoptotic multidomain and BH3-only proteins via a BH3 domain, thereby serving as a novel BH3 receptor, using in vitro fluorescent polarization (FP), isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), and cell-based co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments, 1H-15N-transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy (TROSY-HSQC), trypsin proteolysis, ATPase activity, and denatured rhodanese aggregation measurements further demonstrated that BimBH3 binds to a novel allosteric site in the nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) of Hsp70, by which Bim acts as a positive co-chaperone to promote the ATPase activity and chaperone functions. A dual role of Hsp70's anti-apoptotic function was revealed that when it keeps Bim in check to inhibit apoptosis, it simultaneously stabilizes oncogenic clients including AKT and Raf-1 with the aid of Bim. Two faces of Bim in cell fate regulation were revealed that in opposite to its well-established pro-apoptotic activator role, Bim could help the folding of oncogenic proteins.",1,1.5,"{""Activation"": 1}"
32661194,"The D76N variant of human β2-microglobulin (β2m) is the causative agent of a hereditary amyloid disease. Interestingly, D76N-associated amyloidosis has a distinctive pathology compared with aggregation of WT-β2m, which occurs in dialysis-related amyloidosis. A folding intermediate of WT-β2m, known as the IT-state, which contains a nonnative trans Pro-32, has been shown to be a key precursor of WT-β2m aggregation in vitro However, how a single amino acid substitution enhances the rate of aggregation of D76N-β2m and gives rise to a different amyloid disease remained unclear. Using real-time refolding experiments monitored by CD and NMR, we show that the folding mechanisms of WT- and D76N-β2m are conserved in that both proteins fold slowly via an IT-state that has similar structural properties. Surprisingly, however, direct measurement of the equilibrium population of IT using NMR showed no evidence for an increased population of the IT-state for D76N-β2m, ruling out previous models suggesting that this could explain its enhanced aggregation propensity. Producing a kinetically trapped analog of IT by deleting the N-terminal six amino acids increases the aggregation rate of WT-β2m but slows aggregation of D76N-β2m, supporting the view that although the folding mechanisms of the two proteins are conserved, their aggregation mechanisms differ. The results exclude the IT-state as the origin of the rapid aggregation of D76N-β2m, suggesting that other nonnative states must cause its high aggregation rate. The results highlight how a single substitution at a solvent-exposed site can affect the mechanism of aggregation and the resulting disease.",0,0.0,{}
32661195,"A remarkable charge transfer (CT) band is described in the bifurcating electron transfer flavoprotein (Bf-ETF) from Rhodopseudomonas palustris (RpaETF). RpaETF contains two FADs that play contrasting roles in electron bifurcation. The Bf-FAD accepts electrons pairwise from NADH, directs one to a lower-reduction midpoint potential (E°) carrier, and the other to the higher-E° electron transfer FAD (ET-FAD). Previous work noted that a CT band at 726 nm formed when ET-FAD was reduced and Bf-FAD was oxidized, suggesting that both flavins participate. However, existing crystal structures place them too far apart to interact directly. We present biochemical experiments addressing this conundrum and elucidating the nature of this CT species. We observed that RpaETF missing either FAD lacked the 726 nm band. Site-directed mutagenesis near either FAD produced altered yields of the CT species, supporting involvement of both flavins. The residue substitutions did not alter the absorption maximum of the signal, ruling out contributions from residue orbitals. Instead, we propose that the residue identities modulate the population of a protein conformation that brings the ET-flavin and Bf-flavin into direct contact, explaining the 726 nm band based on a CT complex of reduced ET-FAD and oxidized Bf-FAD. This is corroborated by persistence of the 726 nm species during gentle protein denaturation and simple density functional theory calculations of flavin dimers. Although such a CT complex has been demonstrated for free flavins, this is the first observation of such, to our knowledge, in an enzyme. Thus, Bf-ETFs may optimize electron transfer efficiency by enabling direct flavin-flavin contact.",2,4.5,"{""Activation"": 2}"
32661196,"UDP-glucuronic acid is converted to UDP-galacturonic acid en route to a variety of sugar-containing metabolites. This reaction is performed by a NAD+-dependent epimerase belonging to the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase family. We present several high-resolution crystal structures of the UDP-glucuronic acid epimerase from Bacillus cereus The geometry of the substrate-NAD+ interactions is finely arranged to promote hydride transfer. The exquisite complementarity between glucuronic acid and its binding site is highlighted by the observation that the unligated cavity is occupied by a cluster of ordered waters whose positions overlap the polar groups of the sugar substrate. Co-crystallization experiments led to a structure where substrate- and product-bound enzymes coexist within the same crystal. This equilibrium structure reveals the basis for a ""swing and flip"" rotation of the pro-chiral 4-keto-hexose-uronic acid intermediate that results from glucuronic acid oxidation, placing the C4' atom in position for receiving a hydride ion on the opposite side of the sugar ring. The product-bound active site is almost identical to that of the substrate-bound structure and satisfies all hydrogen-bonding requirements of the ligand. The structure of the apoenzyme together with the kinetic isotope effect and mutagenesis experiments further outlines a few flexible loops that exist in discrete conformations, imparting structural malleability required for ligand rotation while avoiding leakage of the catalytic intermediate and/or side reactions. These data highlight the double nature of the enzymatic mechanism: the active site features a high degree of precision in substrate recognition combined with the flexibility required for intermediate rotation.",0,0.0,{}

Its emergence into the human population and ensuing pandemic came on the heels of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), two other highly pathogenic coronavirus spillovers, which collectively have reshaped our view of a virus family previously associated primarily with the common cold. It has placed intense pressure on the collective scientific community to develop therapeutics and vaccines, whose engineering relies on a detailed understanding of coronavirus biology. Here, we present the molecular virology of coronavirus infection, including its entry into cells, its remarkably sophisticated gene expression and replication mechanisms, its extensive remodeling of the intracellular environment, and its multifaceted immune evasion strategies.

32661198,"Phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3)-dependent Rac exchanger 1 (P-Rex1) catalyzes the exchange of GDP for GTP on Rac GTPases, thereby triggering changes in the actin cytoskeleton and in transcription. Its overexpression is highly correlated with the metastasis of certain cancers. P-Rex1 recruitment to the plasma membrane and its activity are regulated via interactions with heterotrimeric Gβγ subunits, PIP3, and protein kinase A (PKA). Deletion analysis has further shown that domains C-terminal to its catalytic Dbl homology (DH) domain confer autoinhibition. Among these, the first dishevelled, Egl-10, and pleckstrin domain (DEP1) remains to be structurally characterized. DEP1 also harbors the primary PKA phosphorylation site, suggesting that an improved understanding of this region could substantially increase our knowledge of P-Rex1 signaling and open the door to new selective chemotherapeutics. Here we show that the DEP1 domain alone can autoinhibit activity in context of the DH/PH-DEP1 fragment of P-Rex1 and interacts with the DH/PH domains in solution. The 3.1 Å crystal structure of DEP1 features a domain swap, similar to that observed previously in the Dvl2 DEP domain, involving an exposed basic loop that contains the PKA site. Using purified proteins, we show that although DEP1 phosphorylation has no effect on the activity or solution conformation of the DH/PH-DEP1 fragment, it inhibits binding of the DEP1 domain to liposomes containing phosphatidic acid. Thus, we propose that PKA phosphorylation of the DEP1 domain hampers P-Rex1 binding to negatively charged membranes in cells, freeing the DEP1 domain to associate with and inhibit the DH/PH module.",3,3.5,"{""Translocation"": 1, ""Activation"": 2}"
32661339,"Stem cells undergo dynamic changes in response to injury to regenerate lost cells. However, the identity of transitional states and the mechanisms that drive their trajectories remain understudied. Using lung organoids, multiple in vivo repair models, single-cell transcriptomics and lineage tracing, we find that alveolar type-2 epithelial cells undergoing differentiation into type-1 cells acquire pre-alveolar type-1 transitional cell state (PATS) en route to terminal maturation. Transitional cells undergo extensive stretching during differentiation, making them vulnerable to DNA damage. Cells in the PATS show an enrichment of TP53, TGFβ, DNA-damage-response signalling and cellular senescence. Gain and loss of function as well as genomic binding assays revealed a direct transcriptional control of PATS by TP53 signalling. Notably, accumulation of PATS-like cells in human fibrotic lungs was observed, suggesting persistence of the transitional state in fibrosis. Our study thus implicates a transient state associated with senescence in normal epithelial tissue repair and its abnormal persistence in disease conditions.",0,0.0,{}
32665399,"Protein glycosylation is essential to trafficking and immune functions of human neutrophils. During granulopoiesis in the bone marrow, distinct neutrophil granules are successively formed. Distinct receptors and effector proteins, many of which are glycosylated, are targeted to each type of granule according to their time of expression, a process called ""targeting by timing."" Therefore, these granules are time capsules reflecting different times of maturation that can be used to understand the glycosylation process during granulopoiesis. Herein, neutrophil subcellular granules were fractionated by Percoll density gradient centrifugation, and N- and O-glycans present in each compartment were analyzed by LC-MS. We found abundant paucimannosidic N-glycans and lack of O-glycans in the early-formed azurophil granules, whereas the later-formed specific and gelatinase granules and secretory vesicles contained complex N- and O-glycans with remarkably elongated N-acetyllactosamine repeats with Lewis epitopes. Immunoblotting and histochemical analysis confirmed the expression of Lewis X and sialyl-Lewis X in the intracellular granules and on the cell surface, respectively. Many glycans identified are unique to neutrophils, and their complexity increased progressively from azurophil granules to specific granules and then to gelatinase granules, suggesting temporal changes in the glycosylation machinery indicative of ""glycosylation by timing"" during granulopoiesis. In summary, this comprehensive neutrophil granule glycome map, the first of its kind, highlights novel granule-specific glycosylation features and is a crucial first step toward a better understanding of the mechanisms regulating protein glycosylation during neutrophil granulopoiesis and a more detailed understanding of neutrophil biology and function.",0,0.0,{}
32665400,"The accumulation-associated protein (Aap) from Staphylococcus epidermidis is a biofilm-related protein that was found to be a critical factor for infection using a rat catheter model. The B-repeat superdomain of Aap, composed of 5-17 B-repeats, each containing a Zn2+-binding G5 and a spacer subdomain, is responsible for Zn2+-dependent assembly leading to accumulation of bacteria during biofilm formation. We previously demonstrated that a minimal B-repeat construct (Brpt1.5) forms an antiparallel dimer in the presence of 2-3 Zn2+ ions. More recently, we have reported the presence of functional amyloid-like fibrils composed of Aap within S. epidermidis biofilms and demonstrated that a biologically relevant construct containing five and a half B-repeats (Brpt5.5) forms amyloid-like fibrils similar to those observed in the biofilm. In this study, we analyze the initial assembly events of the Brpt5.5 construct. Analytical ultracentrifugation was utilized to determine hydrodynamic parameters of reversibly associating species and to perform linked equilibrium studies. Linkage studies indicated a mechanism of Zn2+-induced dimerization similar to smaller constructs; however, Brpt5.5 dimers could then undergo further Zn2+-induced assembly into a previously uncharacterized tetramer. This led us to search for potential Zn2+-binding sites outside of the dimer interface. We developed a Brpt5.5 mutant that was unable to form the tetramer and was concordantly incapable of amyloidogenesis. CD and dynamic light scattering indicate that a conformational transition in the tetramer species is a critical step preceding amyloidogenesis.

32665401,"Barth syndrome is a mitochondrial myopathy resulting from mutations in the tafazzin (TAZ) gene encoding a phospholipid transacylase required for cardiolipin remodeling. Cardiolipin is a phospholipid of the inner mitochondrial membrane essential for the function of numerous mitochondrial proteins and processes. However, it is unclear how tafazzin deficiency impacts cardiac mitochondrial metabolism. To address this question while avoiding confounding effects of cardiomyopathy on mitochondrial phenotype, we utilized Taz-shRNA knockdown (TazKD ) mice, which exhibit defective cardiolipin remodeling and respiratory supercomplex instability characteristic of human Barth syndrome but normal cardiac function into adulthood. Consistent with previous reports from other models, mitochondrial H2O2 emission and oxidative damage were greater in TazKD than in wild-type (WT) hearts, but there were no differences in oxidative phosphorylation coupling efficiency or membrane potential. Fatty acid and pyruvate oxidation capacities were 40-60% lower in TazKD mitochondria, but an up-regulation of glutamate oxidation supported respiration rates approximating those with pyruvate and palmitoylcarnitine in WT. Deficiencies in mitochondrial CoA and shifts in the cardiac acyl-CoA profile paralleled changes in fatty acid oxidation enzymes and acyl-CoA thioesterases, suggesting limitations of CoA availability or ""trapping"" in TazKD mitochondrial metabolism. Incubation of TazKD mitochondria with exogenous CoA partially rescued pyruvate and palmitoylcarnitine oxidation capacities, implicating dysregulation of CoA-dependent intermediary metabolism rather than respiratory chain defects in the bioenergetic impacts of tafazzin deficiency. These findings support links among cardiolipin abnormalities, respiratory supercomplex instability, and mitochondrial oxidant production and shed new light on the distinct metabolic consequences of tafazzin deficiency in the mammalian heart.",0,0.0,{}
32665402,"Although signal transduction by immunoreceptors such as the T cell antigen receptor (TCR), B cell antigen receptor (BCR), and Fc receptors uses the same schematic and similar molecules, the threshold and the fine-tuning are set differently for each receptor. One manifestation of these differences is that inhibition of Src family kinases (SFK) blocks TCR but not BCR signaling. SFKs are key kinases phosphorylating immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAM) in both these receptors. However, it has been proposed that in B cells, downstream kinase SYK can phosphorylate ITAM sequences independently of SFK, allowing it to compensate for the loss of SFK activity, whereas its T cell paralog ZAP-70 is not capable of this compensation. To test this proposal, we examined signaling in SYK- and ZAP-70-deficient B and T cell lines expressing SYK or ZAP-70. We also analyzed signal transduction in T cells expressing BCR or B cells expressing part of the TCR complex. We show that when compared with ZAP-70, SYK lowered the threshold for SFK activity necessary to initiate antigen receptor signaling in both T and B cells. However, neither SYK nor ZAP-70 were able to initiate signaling independently of SFK. We further found that additional important factors are involved in setting this threshold. These include differences between the antigen receptor complexes themselves and the spatial separation of the key transmembrane adaptor protein LAT from the TCR. Thus, immunoreceptor sensing of SFK activity is a complex process regulated at multiple levels.",5,1.5,"{""Phosphorylation"": 2, ""Activation"": 3}"
32665403,"The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) plays a key role in mammal physiology and in the etiology and progression of inflammatory and oxidative stress-based diseases. In adults, RAGE expression is normally high only in the lung where the protein concentrates in the basal membrane of alveolar Type I epithelial cells. In diseases, RAGE levels increase in the affected tissues and sustain chronic inflammation. RAGE exists as a membrane glycoprotein with an ectodomain, a transmembrane helix, and a short carboxyl-terminal tail, or as a soluble ectodomain that acts as a decoy receptor (sRAGE). VC1 domain is responsible for binding to the majority of RAGE ligands including advanced glycation end products (AGEs), S100 proteins, and HMGB1. To ascertain whether other ligands exist, we analyzed by MS the material pulled down by VC1 from human plasma. Twenty of 295 identified proteins were selected and associated to coagulation and complement processes and to extracellular matrix. Four of them contained a γ-carboxyl glutamic acid (Gla) domain, a calcium-binding module, and prothrombin (PT) was the most abundant. Using MicroScale thermophoresis, we quantified the interaction of PT with VC1 and sRAGE in the absence or presence of calcium that acted as a competitor. PT devoid of the Gla domain (PT des-Gla) did not bind to sRAGE, providing further evidence that the Gla domain is critical for the interaction. Finally, the presence of VC1 delayed plasma clotting in a dose-dependent manner. We propose that RAGE is involved in modulating blood coagulation presumably in conditions of lung injury.",1,1.5,"{""Activation"": 1}"

However, the basis of this resistance is not well defined. We evaluated the stability of AVX-470, a bovine colostral anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) polyclonal antibody used in early clinical studies for treatment of ulcerative colitis, using conditions that mimic the human small intestine. AVX-470 was degraded ∼3 times more slowly than human IgG antibodies or infliximab (a monoclonal mouse-human chimeric IgG). Bovine IgG1 antibodies, the primary component of AVX-470, were slowly cleaved to F(ab')2 fragments. In contrast, bovine IgG2 and human IgG1 antibodies were cleaved rapidly into Fab and smaller fragments, pointing to specific regions where additional stability might be gained. Infliximab was modified to incorporate the sequences from these regions, including the bovine IgG1 hinge region and a predicted disulfide bonding motif linking the upper hinge region, the CH1 domain, and the light chain. This infliximab-bovine IgG1 chimera (bovinized infliximab) retained the antigen binding and neutralization activity of the WT sequence but was degraded 9-fold more slowly than the unmodified infliximab. This remarkable increase in stability with as few as 18 amino acid substitutions suggests that this bovinization process is a means to enable oral delivery of proven therapeutic antibodies as well as novel antibodies to targets that have been previously inaccessible to therapies delivered by injection.",0,0.0,{}

A later pre-60S intermediate shows how the central protuberance arises, assisted by the nearby Rix1-Rea1 machinery, which was solved in its pre-ribosomal context to molecular resolution. This revealed a Rix12-Ipi32 tetramer anchored to the pre-60S via Ipi1, strategically positioned to monitor this decisive remodeling.

This pathway maintains the activity of the Fe-S cluster-containing ribosome recycling factor ABCE1, whose impaired function results in movement of ribosomes into 3' UTRs, where they displace exon junction complexes, abrogating NMD. Importantly, these effects extend beyond NMD substrates, with ABCE1 activity required to maintain the accessibility of 3' UTRs to diverse regulators, including microRNAs and RNA binding proteins.

Indeed, Cdc48 deficiency leads to elevated protein ubiquitination levels and decreased free ubiquitin, which depends on San1/Ubr1. Furthermore, enhancing free ubiquitin levels rescues the toxicity in various Cdc48 pathway mutants and restores normal turnover of a known Cdc48-independent substrate.

We developed a fluorescent zinc granule indicator, ZIGIR, that possesses numerous desired properties for live cell imaging, including >100-fold fluorescence enhancement, membrane permeability, and selective enrichment to acidic granules. The combined advantages endow ZIGIR with superior sensitivity and specificity for imaging granular Zn2+. ZIGIR enables separation of heterogenous β cells based on their insulin content and sorting of mouse islets into pure α cells and β cells. In human islets, ZIGIR facilitates sorting of endocrine cells into highly enriched α cells and β cells, reveals unexpectedly high Zn2+ activity in the somatostatin granule of some δ cells, and uncovers variation in the glucagon content among human α cells.

Mice lacking St18 in myeloid lineages exhibit increased retinal vasculature with enhanced serum VEGF-A concentrations. Despite the normal activation of NF-κB target genes, these mice are highly susceptible to LPS-induced shock, polymicrobial sepsis, and experimental colitis, accompanied by enhanced vascular and intestinal leakage. Pharmacological inhibition of VEGF signaling rescued the high mortality rate of myeloid-specific St18-deficient mice in response to inflammation.

We find that pathogenic tau depletes nuclear Ca2+ and CREB to drive neuronal death, that CREB-regulated genes are over-represented among differentially expressed genes in tau transgenic Drosophila, and that activation of big potassium (BK) channels elevates nuclear Ca2+ and suppresses tau-induced neurotoxicity.

These exosomal microRNAs suppress inflammation by targeting NF-κB and TNF-α signaling and foster M2 polarization in recipient macrophages. Repeated infusions of BMDM-IL-4-exo into Apoe-/- mice fed a Western diet reduce excessive hematopoiesis in the bone marrow and thereby the number of myeloid cells in the circulation and macrophages in aortic root lesions. This also leads to a reduction in necrotic lesion areas that collectively stabilize atheroma.

Through longitudinal monitoring and multi-omics analysis in mice, we found distinct effects of protein, sugar, and fat dietary components, with dietary sugars increasing Mad2l1 expression and tumor proliferation.

Using retrograde labeling of mPFC projections to the BLA, we find that BLA-projecting neurons in the infralimbic cortex (IL) are preferentially activated in response to a social cue as compared with BLA-projecting neurons in the prelimbic cortex (PL). Chemogenetic interrogation of these sub-circuits shows that activation of PL-BLA or inhibition of IL-BLA circuits impairs social behavior. Sustained closed-loop optogenetic activation of PL-BLA circuitry induces social impairment, corresponding to a negative emotional state as revealed by real-time place preference behavioral avoidance.

The mechanisms by which endocardial cells sense these dynamic biomechanical stimuli and how they evoke different cellular responses are largely unknown. Here, we show that blood flow activates two parallel mechanosensitive pathways, one mediated by Notch and the other by Klf2a. Both pathways negatively regulate the angiogenesis receptor Vegfr3/Flt4, which becomes restricted to abluminal endocardial cells. Its loss disrupts valve morphogenesis and results in the occurrence of Notch signaling within abluminal endocardial cells.

Herein, using human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs), we model IOC and screen for drugs to rescue the iron overload phenotypes. Human iPSC-CMs under excess iron exposure recapitulate early-stage IOC, including oxidative stress, arrhythmia, and contractile dysfunction. We find that iron-induced changes in calcium kinetics play a critical role in dysregulation of CM functions. We identify that ebselen, a selective divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) inhibitor and antioxidant, could prevent the observed iron overload phenotypes, supporting the role of DMT1 in iron uptake into the human myocardium.

To reveal their mechanism of action, we generate proteomic organellar maps of control and drug-treated DCs (focusing on two compounds, prazosin and tamoxifen). By combining organellar mapping, quantitative proteomics, and microscopy, we conclude that import enhancers undergo lysosomal trapping leading to membrane permeation and antigen release. Enhancing antigen import facilitates cross-presentation of soluble and cell-associated antigens. Systemic administration of prazosin leads to reduced growth of MC38 tumors and to a synergistic effect with checkpoint immunotherapy in a melanoma model.

Specifically, inhibition of the MAD increases PQ-induced defects in growth and mitochondrial quality and decreases chronological lifespan. We use mass spectrometry analysis to identify possible MAD substrates as mitochondrial proteins that exhibit increased ubiquitination in response to PQ treatment and inhibition of the MAD. We identify candidate substrates in the mitochondrial matrix and inner membrane and confirm that two matrix proteins are MAD substrates.

The first involves precise spatiotemporal endothelial-neuroblast cytoneme contacts and Dll4-Notch signaling to restrain neuroblast proliferation. The second, instead, requires blood flow to trigger a transcriptional response that modifies neuroblast metabolic status and induces sensory neuron differentiation. In contrast, no role of sensory neurogenesis in vascular development is found, suggesting unidirectional signaling from vasculature to sensory neuroblasts.

The formation of primary cilia (i.e. ciliogenesis) requires dynamic membrane trafficking events, and several Rab small GTPases, key regulators of membrane trafficking, have recently been reported to participate in ciliogenesis. However, the precise mechanisms of Rab-mediated membrane trafficking during ciliogenesis remain largely unknown. In the present study, we used a collection of siRNAs against 62 human Rabs to perform a comprehensive knockdown screening for Rabs that regulate serum starvation-induced ciliogenesis in human telomerase reverse transcriptase retinal pigment epithelium 1 (hTERT-RPE1) cells and succeeded in identifying Rab34 as an essential Rab. Knockout (KO) of Rab34, but not of Rabs previously reported to regulate ciliogenesis (e.g. Rab8 and Rab10) in hTERT-RPE1 cells, drastically impaired serum starvation-induced ciliogenesis. Rab34 was also required for serum starvation-induced ciliogenesis in NIH/3T3 cells and MCF10A cells but not for ciliogenesis in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK)-II cysts. We then attempted to identify a specific region(s) of Rab34 that is essential for ciliogenesis by performing deletion and mutation analyses of Rab34. Unexpectedly, instead of a specific sequence in the switch II region, which is generally important for recognizing effector proteins (e.g. Rab interacting lysosomal protein [RILP]), a unique long N-terminal region of Rab34 before the conserved GTPase domain was found to be essential.

We also reported that SMAD ubiquitination regulatory factor 2 (SMURF2) ligase activity is important in stabilizing EGFR. However, the molecular mechanisms involved remain unclear. Here, using in vitro and in vivo ubiquitination assays, MS, and superresolution microscopy, we show SMURF2-EGFR functional interaction is important for EGFR stability and response to TKI. We demonstrate that L858R/T790M EGFR is preferentially stabilized by SMURF2-UBCH5 (an E3-E2)-mediated polyubiquitination. We identified four lysine residues as the sites of ubiquitination and showed that replacement of one of them with acetylation-mimicking glutamine increases the sensitivity of mutant EGFR to erlotinib-induced degradation. We show that SMURF2 extends membrane retention of EGF-bound EGFR, whereas SMURF2 knockdown increases receptor sorting to lysosomes. In lung cancer cell lines, SMURF2 overexpression increased EGFR levels, improving TKI tolerance, whereas SMURF2 knockdown decreased EGFR steady-state levels and sensitized lung cancer cells. Overall, we propose that SMURF2-mediated polyubiquitination of L858R/T790M EGFR competes with acetylation-mediated receptor internalization that correlates with enhanced receptor stability; therefore, disruption of the E3-E2 complex may be an attractive target to overcome TKI resistance.",4,12.0,"{""Complex"": 1, ""IncreaseAmount"": 3}"

O-Glycosylation is initiated by a large family of enzymes (GALNTs in mammals and PGANTs in Drosophila) that catalyze the addition of GalNAc onto the hydroxyl groups of serines or threonines in protein substrates. These enzymes contain two functional domains: a catalytic domain and a C-terminal ricin-like lectin domain comprised of three potential GalNAc recognition repeats termed α, β, and γ. The catalytic domain is responsible for binding donor and acceptor substrates and catalyzing transfer of GalNAc, whereas the lectin domain recognizes more distant extant GalNAc on previously glycosylated substrates. We previously demonstrated a novel role for the α repeat of lectin domain in influencing charged peptide preferences. Here, we further interrogate how the differentially spliced α repeat of the PGANT9A and PGANT9B O-glycosyltransferases confers distinct preferences for a variety of endogenous substrates. Through biochemical analyses and in silico modeling using preferred substrates, we find that a combination of charged residues within the α repeat and charged residues in the flexible gating loop of the catalytic domain distinctively influence the peptide substrate preferences of each splice variant. Moreover, PGANT9A and PGANT9B also display unique glycopeptide preferences. These data illustrate how changes within the noncatalytic lectin domain can alter the recognition of both peptide and glycopeptide substrates.

ESX-1, ESX-3, and ESX-5 systems have been shown to each secrete a distinct set of substrates, including PE and PPE families of proteins, named for conserved Pro-Glu and Pro-Pro-Glu motifs in their N termini. Proper secretion of the PE-PPE proteins requires the presence of EspG, with each system encoding its own unique copy. There is no cross-talk between any of the ESX systems, and how each EspG recognizes its subset of PE-PPE proteins is currently unknown. The only current structural characterization of PE-PPE-EspG heterotrimers is from the ESX-5 system. Here we present the crystal structure of the PE5mt-PPE4mt-EspG3mm heterotrimer from the ESX-3 system. Our heterotrimer reveals that EspG3mm interacts exclusively with PPE4mt in a similar manner to EspG5, shielding the hydrophobic tip of PPE4mt from solvent. The C-terminal helical domain of EspG3mm is dynamic, alternating between ""open"" and ""closed"" forms, and this movement is likely functionally relevant in the unloading of PE-PPE heterodimers at the secretion machinery. In contrast to the previously solved ESX-5 heterotrimers, the PE-PPE heterodimer of our ESX-3 heterotrimer is interacting with its chaperone at a drastically different angle and presents different faces of the PPE protein to the chaperone.

Here, we report a hook complex-associated protein named BOH2 that plays an essential role in promoting flagellum inheritance. BOH2 localizes to the hooked part of the hook complex by bridging the hook complex, the centrin arm, and the flagellum attachment zone filament. Depletion of BOH2 caused the loss of the shank part of the hook complex and its associated protein TbSmee1, disrupted the assembly of the centrin arm and the recruitment of centrin arm-associated protein CAAP1, inhibited the assembly of the flagellum attachment zone, and caused flagellum mispositioning and detachment.

We also find that Caspr2 is highly enriched at synaptic specializations in the cerebellum. Using a proteomics approach, we identify type 1 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R1) as a specific synaptic interaction partner of the Caspr2 extracellular domain in the molecular layer of the developing cerebellum.

Using stable isotope dilution LC-MS/MS, we detected the formation of 3-bromotyrosine, a specific biomarker of HOBr-mediated protein modification. The level of 3-bromotyrosine in extracellular matrix proteins from normally cultured cells was 1.1 mmol/mol tyrosine and decreased significantly in the presence of the peroxidasin inhibitor, phloroglucinol. A negligible amount of 3-bromotyrosine was detected in peroxidasin-knockout cells. 3-Bromotyrosine formed both during cell growth in culture and in the isolated decellularized extracellular matrix when embedded peroxidasin was supplied with hydrogen peroxide and bromide.

The YAP activity of the different YAP1 fusions is resistant to negative Hippo pathway regulation due to constitutive nuclear localization and resistance to degradation of the YAP1 fusion proteins. Genetic disruption of the TEAD-binding domain of these oncogenic YAP1 fusions is sufficient to inhibit tumor formation in vivo, while pharmacological inhibition of the YAP1-TEAD interaction inhibits the growth of YAP1 fusion-expressing cell lines in vitro.

We show that parS and ParB associate to form nanometer-sized, round condensates. ParB molecules diffuse rapidly within the nucleoid volume but display confined motions when trapped inside ParB condensates. Single ParB molecules are able to rapidly diffuse between different condensates, and nucleation is strongly favored by parS. Notably, the ParA motor is required to prevent the fusion of ParB condensates. These results describe a novel active mechanism that splits, segregates, and localizes non-canonical LLPS condensates in the subcellular space.",1,0.0,"{""Inhibition"": 1}"
32679077,"Accurate regulation of innate immunity is necessary for the host to efficiently respond to invading pathogens and avoid excessive harmful immune pathology. Here we identified OTUD3 as an acetylation-dependent deubiquitinase that restricts innate antiviral immune signaling. OTUD3 deficiency in mice results in enhanced innate immunity, a diminished viral load, and morbidity. OTUD3 directly hydrolyzes lysine 63 (Lys63)-linked polyubiquitination of MAVS and thus shuts off innate antiviral immune response. Notably, the catalytic activity of OTUD3 relies on acetylation of its Lys129 residue. In response to virus infection, the acetylated Lys129 is removed by SIRT1, which promptly inactivates OTUD3 and thus allows timely induction of innate antiviral immunity. Importantly, acetyl-OTUD3 levels are inversely correlated with IFN-β expression in influenza patients. These findings establish OTUD3 as a repressor of MAVS and uncover a previously unknown regulatory mechanism by which the catalytic activity of OTUD3 is tightly controlled to ensure timely activation of antiviral defense.",2,4.5,"{""Inhibition"": 1, ""Activation"": 1}"

Cohesion is created by DNA topological links and proteinaceous bridges, whose formation and deposition could be potentially affected by many processes. Current knowledge on cohesion has been mainly gained by fluorescence microscopy observation. However, the resolution limit of microscopy and the restricted number of genomic positions that can be simultaneously visualized considerably hampered progress. Here, we present a high-throughput methodology to monitor sister-chromatid contacts (Hi-SC2).

32690606,"Pancreas/duodenum homeobox protein 1 (PDX1) is an important transcription factor that regulates islet β-cell proliferation, differentiation, and function. Reduced expression of PDX1 is thought to contribute to β-cell loss and dysfunction in diabetes. Thus, promoting PDX1 expression can be an effective strategy to preserve β-cell mass and function. Previously, we established a PDX1 promoter-dependent luciferase system to screen agents that can promote PDX1 expression. Natural compound tectorigenin (TG) was identified as a promising candidate that could enhance the activity of the promoter for the PDX1 gene. In this study, we first demonstrated that TG could promote the expression of PDX1 in β-cells via activating extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK), as indicated by increased phosphorylation of ERK; this effect was observed under either normal or glucotoxic/lipotoxic conditions. We then found that TG could suppress induced apoptosis and improved the viability of β-cells under glucotoxicity and lipotoxicity by activation of ERK and reduction of reactive oxygen species and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. These effects held true in vivo as well: prophylactic or therapeutic use of TG could obviously inhibit ER stress and decrease islet β-cell apoptosis in the pancreas of mice given a high-fat/high-sucrose diet (HFHSD), thus dramatically maintaining or restoring β-cell mass and islet size, respectively. Accordingly, both prophylactic and therapeutic use of TG improved HFHSD-impaired glucose metabolism in mice, as evidenced by ameliorating hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance.

Whereas many details of Na+-NQR structure and function are known, the mechanisms of action of potent inhibitors is not well-understood; elucidating the mechanisms would not only advance drug design strategies but might also provide insights on a terminal electron transfer from riboflavin to UQ. To this end, we performed photoaffinity labeling experiments using photoreactive derivatives of two known inhibitors, aurachin and korormicin, on isolated Vibrio cholerae Na+-NQR. The inhibitors labeled the cytoplasmic surface domain of the NqrB subunit including a protruding N-terminal stretch, which may be critical to regulate the UQ reaction in the adjacent NqrA subunit. The labeling was blocked by short-chain UQs such as ubiquinone-2. The photolabile group (2-aryl-5-carboxytetrazole (ACT)) of these inhibitors reacts with nucleophilic amino acids, so we tested mutations of nucleophilic residues in the labeled region of NqrB, such as Asp49 and Asp52 (to Ala), and observed moderate decreases in labeling yields, suggesting that these residues are involved in the interaction with ACT. We conclude that the inhibitors interfere with the UQ reaction in two ways: the first is blocking structural rearrangements at the cytoplasmic interface between NqrA and NqrB, and the second is the direct obstruction of UQ binding at this interfacial area. Unusual competitive behavior between the photoreactive inhibitors and various competitors corroborates our previous proposition that there may be two inhibitor binding sites in Na+-NQR.",0,0.0,{}

Ozone reacts with cholesterol in the lung to form oxysterols, like secosterol A and secosterol B (SecoA and SecoB), which can form covalent adducts on cellular proteins. How oxysterol-protein adduction modifies the function of lung macrophages is unknown. Herein, we used a proteomic screen to identify lung macrophage proteins that form adducts with ozone-derived oxysterols. Functional ontology analysis of the adductome indicated that protein binding was a major function of adducted proteins. Further analysis of specific proteins forming adducts with SecoA identified the phagocytic receptors CD206 and CD64. Adduction of these receptors with ozone-derived oxysterols impaired ligand binding and corresponded with reduced macrophage phagocytosis. This work suggests a novel mechanism for the suppression of macrophage phagocytosis following ozone exposure through the generation of oxysterols and the formation of oxysterol-protein adducts on phagocytic receptors.",4,0.0,"{""Activation"": 4}"

Cch1 is homologous to the pore-forming α1 subunit of animal voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCs) and sodium leak channels nonselective (NALCNs), whereas Mid1 is a membrane-associated protein similar to the regulatory α2/δ subunit of VGCCs and the regulatory subunit of NALCNs. Although the physiological roles of Cch1/Mid1 channels are known, their molecular regulation remains elusive, including subunit interactions regulating channel functionality. Herein, we identify amino acid residues involved in interactions between the pore-forming Cch1 subunit and the essential regulatory Mid1 subunit of Saccharomyces cerevisiaeIn vitro mutagenesis followed by functional assays and co-immunoprecipitation experiments reveal that three residues present in a specific extracellular loop in the repeat III region of Cch1 are required for interaction with Mid1, and that one essential Mid1 residue is required for interaction with Cch1.

A major site of BA action is the terminal ileum, where enterocytes actively reuptake BAs and express high levels of BA-sensitive nuclear receptors. BA pool size and composition are affected by changes in metabolic health, and vice versa. One of several factors that differentiate BAs is the presence of a hydroxyl group on C12 of the steroid ring. 12α-Hydroxylated BAs (12HBAs) are altered in multiple disease settings, but the consequences of 12HBA abundance are incompletely understood. We employed mouse primary ileum organoids to investigate the transcriptional effects of varying 12HBA abundance in BA pools. We identified Slc30a10 as one of the top genes differentially induced by BA pools with varying 12HBA abundance. SLC30A10 is a manganese efflux transporter critical for whole-body manganese excretion. We found that BA pools, especially those low in 12HBAs, induce cellular manganese efflux and that Slc30a10 induction by BA pools is driven primarily by lithocholic acid signaling via the vitamin D receptor. Administration of lithocholic acid or a vitamin D receptor agonist resulted in increased Slc30a10 expression in mouse ileum epithelia.

Interferon regulatory factor 2 (IRF2) negatively regulates interferon signalling3, and mice completely lacking Irf24 or with a selective Irf2 deletion in their intestinal epithelial cells have significantly fewer crypt Lgr5hi ISCs than control mice. Although the integrity of intestinal epithelial cells was unimpaired at steady state in Irf2-deficient mice, regeneration of their intestinal epithelia after 5-fluorouracil-induced damage was severely impaired. Similarly, extended treatment with low-dose poly(I:C) or chronic infection of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus clone 13 (LCMV C13)5 caused a functional decline of ISCs in wild-type mice. In contrast, massive accumulations of immature Paneth cells were found at the crypt base of Irf2-/- as well as LCMV C13-infected wild-type mice, indicating that excess interferon signalling directs ISCs towards a secretory-cell fate.

MAGE-B2 reduces G3BP protein levels below the critical concentration for phase separation and suppresses SG initiation. Knockout of the MAGE-B2 mouse ortholog or overexpression of G3BP1 confers hypersensitivity of the male germline to heat stress in vivo.

Unexpectedly, the conformation of inhibited Sec61 is optimal for substrate engagement, with mycolactone wedging open the cytosolic side of the lateral gate. The inability of mycolactone-inhibited Sec61 to effectively transport substrate proteins implies that signal peptides and transmembrane domains pass through the site occupied by mycolactone.

During this process, the two-component carnitine monooxygenase (CntAB) catalyzes the oxygen-dependent cleavage of carnitine to TMA and malic semialdehyde. Individual redox states of the reductase CntB and the catalytic component CntA were investigated based on mutagenesis and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopic approaches. Protein ligands of the flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and the plant-type [2Fe-2S] cluster of CntB and also of the Rieske-type [2Fe-2S] cluster and the mononuclear [Fe] center of CntA were identified. EPR spectroscopy of variant CntA proteins suggested a hierarchical metallocenter maturation, Rieske [2Fe-2S] followed by the mononuclear [Fe] center. NADH-dependent electron transfer via the redox components of CntB and within the trimeric CntA complex for the activation of molecular oxygen was investigated. EPR experiments indicated that the two electrons from NADH were allocated to the plant-type [2Fe-2S] cluster and to FMN in the form of a flavin semiquinone radical. Single-turnover experiments of this reduced CntB species indicated the translocation of the first electron onto the [Fe] center and the second electron onto the Rieske-type [2Fe-2S] cluster of CntA to finally allow for oxygen activation as a basis for carnitine cleavage.

However, despite the continued presence of estrogen before menopause, ERα protein levels are maintained. We discovered that ERK1/2-RSK2 activity oscillates during the estrous cycle. In response to high estrogen levels, ERK1/2 is activated and phosphorylates ERα to drive ERα degradation and estrogen-responsive gene expression. Reduction of estrogen levels results in ERK1/2 deactivation. RSK2 maintains redox homeostasis, which prevents sustained ERK1/2 activation. In juveniles, ERK1/2-RSK2 activity is not required. Mammary gland regeneration demonstrates that ERK1/2-RSK2 regulation of ERα is intrinsic to the epithelium. Reduced RSK2 and enrichment in an estrogen-regulated gene signature occur in individuals taking oral contraceptives.

Promoters of genes require INTS11 to cleave nascent transcripts associated with paused RNAPII and induce their premature termination in the proximity of the +1 nucleosome. The turnover of RNAPII permits the subsequent recruitment of an elongation-competent RNAPII complex, leading to productive elongation. In contrast, enhancers require INTS11 catalysis not to evict paused RNAPII but rather to terminate enhancer RNA transcription beyond the +1 nucleosome. These findings are supported by the differential occupancy of negative elongation factor (NELF), SPT5, and tyrosine-1-phosphorylated RNAPII.

Here we report on divergent genomes from major lineages across the Saccharibacteria phylum in humans and mammals, as well as from ancient dental calculus. These lineages are present at high prevalence within hosts. Direct imaging reveals that all groups are ultra-small in size, likely feeding off commensal bacteria.

However, it remains unknown how CR acts on mutation retention at the tissue level. Here, we use Cre-mediated DNA recombination of the confetti reporter as proxy for neutral mutations and follow these mutations by intravital microscopy to identify how CR affects retention of mutations in the intestine. We find that CR leads to increased numbers of functional Lgr5+ stem cells that compete for niche occupancy, resulting in slower but stronger stem cell competition. Consequently, stem cells carrying neutral or Apc mutations encounter more wild-type competitors, thus increasing the chance that they get displaced from the niche to get lost over time. Thus, our data show that CR not only affects the acquisition of mutations but also leads to lower retention of mutations in the intestine.",1,1.5,"{""Activation"": 1}"

Despite its expression in the mammalian brain, little is known about the contribution of TRPA1 to cortical function. Here, we characterize how TRPA1 affects sensory information processing in two cortical areas in mice: the primary vibrissal (whisker) somatosensory cortex (vS1) and the primary visual cortex (V1). In vS1, local activation of TRPA1 by allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) increases the ongoing activity of neurons and their evoked response to vibrissal stimulation, producing a positive gain modulation. The gain modulation is reversed by TRPA1 inhibitor HC-030031 and is absent in TRPA1 knockout mice. Similarly, in V1, TRPA1 activation increases the gain of direction and orientation selectivity. Linear decoding of V1 population activity confirms faster and more reliable encoding of visual signals under TRPA1 activation.

How unconstrained ncRNA levels affect RNA metabolism and gene expression are long-standing and important questions. Here, we show that degradation of ncRNAs by the exosome is required for freeing Nrd1 and Nab3 from the released transcript after termination. In exosome mutants, these factors are sequestered by ncRNAs and cannot be efficiently recycled to sites of transcription, inducing termination defects at NNS targets. ncRNA-dependent, genome-wide termination defects can be recapitulated by the expression of a degradation-resistant, circular RNA containing a natural NNS target in exosome-proficient cells.

In 3D, microtubules grow unrestrained from the actomyosin cytoskeleton into the growth cone leading edge to enable rapid axon extension. Axons extend and polarize even in adhesion-inert matrices.

TLR2 stimulation induced the activation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and ERK, leading to much higher production of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) by T helper 1 (Th1) cells cultured in a high concentration of IL-2 than by those cultured in a low concentration of IL-2. In contrast, TLR2 stimulation induces mTORC1 activation through TIRAP, which is essential for TLR2-mediated IFN-γ production.

ABCB transporters are critical for this polar auxin distribution, but the regulatory mechanisms controlling their function is not fully understood. The auxin transport activity of ABCB1 was suggested to be regulated by a physical interaction with FKBP42/Twisted Dwarf1 (TWD1), a peptidylprolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase), but all attempts to demonstrate such a PPIase activity by TWD1 have failed so far. By using a structure-based approach, we identified several surface-exposed proline residues in the nucleotide binding domain and linker of Arabidopsis ABCB1, mutations of which do not alter ABCB1 protein stability or location but do affect its transport activity. P1008 is part of a conserved signature D/E-P motif that seems to be specific for auxin-transporting ABCBs, which we now refer to as ATAs. Mutation of the acidic residue also abolishes auxin transport activity by ABCB1. All higher plant ABCBs for which auxin transport has been conclusively proven carry this conserved motif, underlining its predictive potential. Introduction of this D/E-P motif into malate importer, ABCB14, increases both its malate and its background auxin transport activity, suggesting that this motif has an impact on transport capacity. The D/E-P1008 motif is also important for ABCB1-TWD1 interactions and activation of ABCB1-mediated auxin transport by TWD1.

SGR occurs when a gene sequence is cut and recombined within a single cell's genomic DNA, generally independent of DNA replication and the cell cycle. The newly identified brain SGR produces genomic complementary DNAs (gencDNAs) lacking introns, which integrate into locations distinct from germline loci. This brief review will present an overview of likely related recombination mechanisms and genomic cDNA-like sequences that implicate evolutionary origins for brain SGR. Similarities and differences exist between brain SGR and VDJ recombination in the immune system, the first identified SGR form that now has a well-defined enzymatic machinery. Both require gene transcription, but brain SGR uses an RNA intermediate and reverse transcriptase (RT) activity, which are characteristics shared with endogenous retrotransposons. The identified gencDNAs have similarities to other cDNA-like sequences existing throughout phylogeny, including intron-less genes and inactive germline processed pseudogenes, with likely overlapping biosynthetic processes. gencDNAs arise somatically in an individual to produce multiple copies; can be functional; appear most frequently within postmitotic cells; have diverse sequences; change with age; and can change with disease state. Normally occurring brain SGR may represent a mechanism for gene optimization and long-term cellular memory, whereas its dysregulation could underlie multiple brain disorders and, potentially, other diseases like cancer.

Multiple residues in the C terminus of eIF6 are phosphorylated by GSK3 in a sequential manner. In response to serum starvation, eIF6 accumulates in the cytoplasm, and this altered localization depends on phosphorylation by GSK3. Disruption of eIF6 phosphorylation exacerbates the translation inhibitory response to serum starvation and stalls cell growth.

However, systematic investigation requires a quantitative analysis of FA's ability to denature proteins. Amyloid formed by Pseudomonas sp. protein FapC provides an excellent model to investigate FA denaturation. It contains three imperfect repeats, and stepwise removal of these repeats slows fibrillation and increases fragmentation during aggregation. However, the link to stability is unclear. We first calibrated FA denaturation using three small, globular, and acid-resistant proteins. This revealed a linear relationship between the concentration of FA and the free energy of unfolding with a slope of mFA+pH (the combined contribution of FA and FA-induced lowering of pH), as well as a robust correlation between protein size and mFA+pH We then measured the solubilization of fibrils formed from different FapC variants with varying numbers of repeats as a function of the concentration of FA. This revealed a decline in the number of residues driving amyloid formation upon deleting at least two repeats. The midpoint of denaturation declined with the removal of repeats.

Initially, a conserved glutamate at the active site was believed to generate the nucleophile necessary to accomplish the reaction. Later this role was alluded to a Mg2+ ion. However, no study has unequivocally established a catalytic mechanism for (p)ppGpp synthesis. Here we present a revised mechanism, wherein for the first time we explore a role for 2'-OH of GTP and show how it is important in generating the nucleophile. Through a careful comparison of substrate-bound structures of Rel, we illustrate that the active site does not discriminate GTP from dGTP, for a substrate. Using biochemical studies, we demonstrate that both GTP and dGTP bind to Rel, but only GTP (but not dGTP) can form the product. Reactions performed using GTP analogs substituted with different chemical moieties at the 2' position suggest a clear role for 2'-OH in catalysis by providing an indispensable hydrogen bond; preliminary computational analysis further supports this view. This study elucidating a catalytic role for 2'-OH of GTP in (p)ppGpp synthesis allows us to propose different mechanistic possibilities by which it generates the nucleophile for the synthesis reaction.

Here, we present the crystal structure of Arabidopsis thaliana legumain isoform β (AtLEGβ) in its zymogen state. Combining structural and biochemical experiments, we show for the first time that plant legumains encode distinct, isoform-specific activation mechanisms. Whereas the autocatalytic activation of isoform γ (AtLEGγ) is controlled by the latency-conferring dimer state, the activation of the monomeric AtLEGβ is concentration independent. Additionally, in AtLEGβ the plant-characteristic two-chain intermediate state is stabilized by hydrophobic rather than ionic interactions, as in AtLEGγ, resulting in significantly different pH stability profiles. The crystal structure of AtLEGβ revealed unrestricted nonprime substrate binding pockets, consistent with the broad substrate specificity, as determined by degradomic assays. Further to its protease activity, we show that AtLEGβ exhibits a true peptide ligase activity. Whereas cleavage-dependent transpeptidase activity has been reported for other plant legumains, AtLEGβ is the first example of a plant legumain capable of linking free termini.

We here demonstrated that human GPx7 has much higher reactivity with H2O2 and hence greater PDI oxidation activity than human GPx8. The high reactivity of GPx7 is due to the presence of a catalytic tetrad at the redox-active site, which stabilizes the sulfenylated species generated upon the reaction with H2O2 Although it was previously postulated that GPx7 catalysis involved a highly reactive peroxidatic cysteine that can be sulfenylated by H2O2, we revealed that a resolving cysteine instead regulates the PDI oxidation activity of GPx7.

For example, sample dilution is always required in the ELISA procedure to determine p24 protein levels because of the very narrow range of detectable concentrations in this assay. Here, we establish a novel HIV-1 production assay system to solve the aforementioned problems by using a recently developed small peptide tag called HiBiT. This peptide is a fragment of NanoLuc luciferase and generates a strong luminescent signal when complemented with the remaining subunit. To employ this technology, we constructed a novel full-length proviral HIV-1 DNA clone and a lentiviral packaging vector in which the HiBiT tag was added to the C terminus of the integrase. Tagging the integrase with the HiBiT sequence did not impede the resultant virus production, infectivity, or susceptibility to an integrase inhibitor.

Nonstop mutations have been characterized in hereditary diseases, but not in cancer genetics. In a pan-cancer analysis, we curated and analysed 3,412 nonstop mutations from 62 tumour entities, generating a comprehensive database at http://NonStopDB.dkfz.de. Six different nonstop extension mutations affected the tumour suppressor SMAD4, extending its carboxy terminus by 40 amino acids. These caused rapid degradation of the SMAD4 mutants via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. A hydrophobic degron signal sequence of ten amino acids within the carboxy-terminal extension was required to induce complete loss of the SMAD4 protein. Thus, we discovered that nonstop mutations can be functionally important in cancer and characterize their loss-of-function impact on the tumour suppressor SMAD4.",0,0.0,{}

However, CBEs such as BE3 can cause genome-wide off-target changes via sgRNA-independent DNA deamination. By leveraging the orthogonal R-loops generated by SaCas9 nickase to mimic actively transcribed genomic loci that are more susceptible to cytidine deaminase, we set up a high-throughput assay for assessing sgRNA-independent off-target effects of CBEs in rice protoplasts. The reliability of this assay was confirmed by the whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of 10 base editors in regenerated rice plants. The R-loop assay was used to screen a series of rationally designed A3Bctd-BE3 variants for improved specificity. We obtained 2 efficient CBE variants, A3Bctd-VHM-BE3 and A3Bctd-KKR-BE3, and the WGS analysis revealed that these new CBEs eliminated sgRNA-independent DNA off-target edits in rice plants.

This negative feedback loop is mediated by two translation inhibitors, GIGYF2 and 4EHP. Model substrates and growth-based assays established that inhibition of additional rounds of translation acts in concert with known RQC pathways to prevent buildup of toxic proteins.

Using Inter-ViSTA with proteomics and molecular virology, we define virus-host interactions for the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) anti-apoptotic protein, pUL37x1. We find that spatiotemporal controlled interactions underlie pUL37x1 functions, facilitating the pro-viral remodeling of mitochondria and peroxisomes during infection. Reciprocal isolations, microscopy, and genetic manipulations further characterize these associations, revealing the interplay between pUL37x1 and the MIB complex, which is critical for mitochondrial integrity.

Here, we identify PHD finger protein 7 (PHF7) as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for histone H3K14 in post-meiotic spermatids. Generation of Phf7-deficient mice and Phf7 C160A knockin mice with impaired E3 ubiquitin ligase activity reveals defects in histone-to-protamine exchange caused by dysregulation of histone removal factor Bromodomain, testis-specific (BRDT) in early condensing spermatids. Surprisingly, E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of PHF7 on histone ubiquitination leads to stabilization of BRDT by attenuating ubiquitination of BRDT.

Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals that the Msi1+ cells are heterogeneous with the majority being intestinal stem cells (ISCs). The DNA damage-resistant subpopulation of Msi1+ cells is characterized by low-to-negative Lgr5 expression and is more rapidly cycling than Lgr5high radiosensitive crypt base columnar stem cells (CBCs). This enables an efficient repopulation of the intestinal epithelium at early stage when Lgr5high cells are not emerging. Furthermore, relative to CBCs, Msi1+ cells preferentially produce Paneth cells during homeostasis and upon radiation repair.

However, the structural features of poised chromatin are largely uncharacterized. By adopting mild time-course MNase-seq with computational analysis, the low-compact chromatin in mESCs is featured in two groups: one in more open regions, corresponding to an active state, and the other enriched with bivalent histone modifications, considered the poised state. A parameter called the chromatin opening potential index (COPI) is also devised to quantify the transcription potential based on the dynamic changes of MNase-seq signals at promoter regions.

Treatment with sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) attenuates the progression of DKD, especially in patients with advanced kidney disease. Herein, we show that in diabetes, mTORC1 activity is increased in renal proximal tubule cells (RPTCs) along with enhanced tubule-interstitial fibrosis; this is prevented by SGLT2i. Constitutive activation of mTORC1 in RPTCs induces renal fibrosis and failure and abolishes the renal-protective effects of SGLT2i in diabetes. On the contrary, partial inhibition of mTORC1 in RPTCs prevents fibrosis and the decline in renal function. Stimulation of mTORC1 in RPTCs turns on a pro-fibrotic program in the renal cortex, whereas its inhibition in diabetes reverses the alterations in gene expression. We suggest that RPTC mTORC1 is a critical node that mediates kidney dysfunction in diabetes and the protective effects of SGLT2i by regulating fibrogenesis.",4,0.0,"{""Activation"": 4}"

The resulting bilateral segregation of MO induces postsynaptic NMDAR (postNMDAR) knockdown in tectal neurons on one side and presynaptic NMDAR (preNMDAR) knockdown in ganglion cells projecting to the other side. PostNMDAR knockdown reduces evoked NMDAR- and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR)-mediated retinotectal currents. Although the frequency of spontaneous synaptic events is increased, the probability of evoked release is reduced. PreNMDAR knockdown results in larger evoked and unitary synaptic responses. Structurally, postNMDAR and preNMDAR knockdown produce complementary effects. Axonal arbor complexity is reduced by preNMDAR-MO and increased by postNMDAR-MO, whereas tectal dendritic arbors exhibit the inverse.

During this process, the prophage does not produce infective phages or cause bacterial lysis, suggesting it has acquired an adaptive behavior suited to the pathogenic lifestyle of its host. In this study, we demonstrate that this non-classical phage behavior, named active lysogeny, relies on a transcriptional response that is specific to the intracellular niche. While the prophage undergoes lytic induction, the process is arrested midway, preventing the transcription of the late genes. Further, we demonstrate key phage factors, such as LlgA transcription regulator and a DNA replicase, that support the phage adaptive behavior.

Remarkably, briefly ex vivo-activated PTPN2-deficient T cells accumulate in 3- to 11-fold higher numbers following transfer into unmanipulated, antigen-free mice. Moreover, the absence of PTPN2 augments the survival of short-lived effector T cells and allows them to robustly re-expand upon secondary challenge. Importantly, we find no evidence for impaired effector function or memory formation. Mechanistically, PTPN2 deficiency causes broad changes in the expression and phosphorylation of T cell expansion and survival-associated proteins.

Gasdermin D (GSDMD)-mediated cell lysis is a hallmark of pyroptosis, but our understanding of cell death signaling during pyroptosis is fragmented. Here, we show that independently of GSDMD-mediated plasma membrane permeabilization, inflammasome receptors engage caspase-1 and caspase-8, both of which redundantly promote activation of apoptotic executioner caspase-3 and caspase-7 in pyroptotic macrophages. Impaired GSDMD pore formation downstream of caspase-1 and caspase-8 activation suffices to unmask the apoptotic phenotype of pyroptotic macrophages. Combined inactivation of initiator caspase-1 and caspase-8, or executioner caspase-3 and caspase-7, is required to abolish inflammasome-induced DEVDase activity during pyroptosis and in apoptotic Gsdmd-/- cells.

We demonstrate that circuit-selective knockout (ctKO) of the ArpC3 gene within prefrontal cortical neurons that project to the basolateral amygdala elevates the excitability of the circuit neurons, leading to disruption of socially evoked neural activity and resulting in abnormal social behavior. Optogenetic activation of this circuit in wild-type mice recapitulates the social dysfunction observed in ArpC3 mutant mice.

Here we show MHC-I-restricted control of murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection in vivo that is NK cell dependent. Using mice lacking specific Ly49 receptors, we show that control of MCMV requires inhibitory Ly49 receptors and an inhibitory signaling motif and the capacity for MCMV to downregulate MHC-I.

Bab2 is necessary to terminate Salivary gland secretion (Sgs) gene expression, while premature Bab2 expression blocks Sgs genes and causes precocious salivary gland histolysis. The timely expression of bab2 is controlled by the ecdysone-responsive transcription factor Broad, and manipulation of EcR/USP/Broad signaling induces inappropriate Bab2 expression and termination of Sgs gene expression.

These subtypes are characterized by distinct sets of driver mutations and phenotypic appearance, and they often show varying degrees of heterogenicity, aggressiveness, and response/resistance to therapy. Intriguingly, lung cancers are also capable of showing features of multiple subtypes or converting from one subtype to another. The intertumoral and intratumoral heterogeneity of lung cancers as well as incidences of subtype transdifferentiation raise the question of to what extent the tumor characteristics are dictated by the cell of origin rather than the acquired driver lesions. We provide here an overview of the studies in experimental mouse models that try to address this question. These studies convincingly show that both the cell of origin and the genetic driver lesions play a critical role in shaping the phenotypes of lung tumors. However, they also illustrate that there is far from a direct one-to-one relationship between the cell of origin and the cancer subtype, as most epithelial cells can be reprogrammed toward diverse lung cancer fates when exposed to the appropriate set of driver mutations.",0,0.0,{}

We report a method that directly defines the RNAP-active-center position relative to DNA with single-nucleotide resolution (XACT-seq; ""crosslink-between-active-center-and-template sequencing""). We apply this method to detect and quantify pausing in initial transcription at 411 (∼4,000,000) promoter sequences in vivo in Escherichia coli. The results show initial-transcription pausing can occur in each nucleotide addition during initial transcription, particularly the first 4 to 5 nucleotide additions. The results further show initial-transcription pausing occurs at sequences that resemble the consensus sequence element for transcription-elongation pausing. Our findings define the positional and sequence determinants for initial-transcription pausing and establish initial-transcription pausing is hard coded by sequence elements similar to those for transcription-elongation pausing.",0,0.0,{}

However, it is not known whether the membrane tension of organelles regulates their functions, notably intracellular traffic. The endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT)-III complex is the major membrane remodelling complex that drives intra-lumenal-vesicle (ILV) formation on endosomal membranes. Here we used a fluorescent membrane-tension probe to show that ESCRT-III subunits are recruited onto endosomal membranes when the membrane tension is reduced. We find that tension-dependent recruitment is associated with ESCRT-III polymerization and membrane deformation in vitro and correlates with increased ILV formation in ESCRT-III-decorated endosomes in vivo. Finally, we find that the endosomal membrane tension decreases when ILV formation is triggered by EGF under physiological conditions. These results indicate that membrane tension is a major regulator of ILV formation and endosome trafficking, leading us to conclude that membrane tension can control organelle functions.",1,0.5,"{""Translocation"": 1}"

Here, to search for such states and decipher their underlying gene regulatory network (GRN), we studied 10 melanoma cultures using single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) as well as 26 additional cultures using bulk RNA-seq. Although each culture exhibited a unique transcriptome, we identified shared GRNs that underlie the extreme melanocytic and mesenchymal states and the intermediate state. This intermediate state is corroborated by a distinct chromatin landscape and is governed by the transcription factors SOX6, NFATC2, EGR3, ELF1 and ETV4. Single-cell migration assays confirmed the intermediate migratory phenotype of this state. Using time-series sampling of single cells after knockdown of SOX10, we unravelled the sequential and recurrent arrangement of GRNs during phenotype switching.

32753672,"Autophagy is a homeostatic process with multiple functions in mammalian cells. Here, we show that mammalian Atg8 proteins (mAtg8s) and the autophagy regulator IRGM control TFEB, a transcriptional activator of the lysosomal system. IRGM directly interacted with TFEB and promoted the nuclear translocation of TFEB. An mAtg8 partner of IRGM, GABARAP, interacted with TFEB. Deletion of all mAtg8s or GABARAPs affected the global transcriptional response to starvation and downregulated subsets of TFEB targets. IRGM and GABARAPs countered the action of mTOR as a negative regulator of TFEB. This was suppressed by constitutively active RagB, an activator of mTOR. Infection of macrophages with the membrane-permeabilizing microbe Mycobacterium tuberculosis or infection of target cells by HIV elicited TFEB activation in an IRGM-dependent manner. Thus, IRGM and its interactors mAtg8s close a loop between the autophagosomal pathway and the control of lysosomal biogenesis by TFEB, thus ensuring coordinated activation of the two systems that eventually merge during autophagy.",1,1.5,"{""Activation"": 1}"

Stable VE-cadherin-based adherens junctions are essential for maintaining this barrier, whereas their remodeling is required for angiogenesis in health and disease. Here, we position the ERAD-associated ubiquitin ligase MARCH6 as a determinant of angiogenic sprouting and barrier integrity through its ability to promote the degradation of the rate-limiting cholesterol biosynthetic enzyme squalene epoxidase (SQLE). Accordingly, MARCHF6 ablation in endothelial cells increases SQLE protein and cholesterol load. This leads to altered membrane order, disorganized adherens junctions, decreased endothelial barrier function, and impaired SQLE-dependent sprouting angiogenesis. Akin to MARCHF6 silencing, the overexpression of SQLE impairs angiogenesis. However, angiogenesis is also attenuated when SQLE is silenced, indicating that fine-tuning cholesterol biosynthesis is a determinant of healthy endothelial function. In summary, we propose a mechanistic link between regulation of cholesterol homeostasis by the MARCH6-SQLE axis and endothelial integrity and angiogenesis.",4,9.0,"{""Inhibition"": 2, ""Activation"": 2}"

Although the individual contributions of these scaffolds have been extensively studied, their respective functions in neurotransmission are still incompletely understood. Here, we analyze the functional interactions of RIMs, RBPs, and Munc13s at the genetic, molecular, functional, and ultrastructural levels in a mammalian synapse. We find that RBP, together with Munc13, promotes vesicle priming at the expense of RBP's role in recruiting presynaptic Ca2+ channels, suggesting that the support of RBP for vesicle priming and Ca2+-secretion coupling is mutually exclusive. Our results demonstrate that the functional interaction of RIM, RBP, and Munc13 is more profound than previously envisioned, acting as a functional trio that govern basic and short-term plasticity properties of neurotransmission.",3,9.0,"{""Complex"": 3}"

Moreover, murine GPR35+ colonic macrophages are characterized by enhanced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. We identify lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) as a potential endogenous ligand produced during intestinal inflammation, acting through GPR35 to induce tumor necrosis factor (Tnf) expression in macrophages. Mice lacking Gpr35 in CX3CR1+ macrophages aggravate colitis when exposed to dextran sodium sulfate, which is associated with decreased transcript levels of the corticosterone-generating gene Cyp11b1 and macrophage-derived Tnf.

Here, in 32 macaques, we test seven vaccination regimens, each comprising multiple immunizations of FP-carrier conjugates and HIV envelope (Env) trimers. Comparisons of vaccine regimens reveal FP-carrier conjugates to imprint cross-clade neutralizing responses and a cocktail of FP conjugate and Env trimer to elicit the earliest broad responses. We identify a signature, appearing as early as week 6 and involving the frequency of B cells recognizing both FP and Env trimer, predictive of vaccine-elicited breadth ∼1 year later.

Using an ex vivo system in which we supply the known survival signals, direct cell contact to stromal cells, and the soluble cytokine a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL), we have elucidated the critical signaling pathways required for the survival of long-lived plasma cells. Integrin-mediated contact of bone marrow plasma cells with stromal cells activates the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway, leading to critical inactivation of Forkhead-Box-Protein O1/3 (FoxO1/3) and preventing the activation of mitochondrial stress-associated effector caspases 3 and 7. Accordingly, inhibition of PI3K signaling in vivo ablates bone marrow plasma cells. APRIL signaling, by the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathway, blocks activation of the endoplasmic-reticulum-stress-associated initiator caspase 12. Thus, stromal-cell-contact-induced PI3K and APRIL-induced NF-κB signaling provide the necessary and complementary signals to maintain bone marrow memory plasma cells.",1,1.5,"{""Inhibition"": 1}"

Failure to maintain heterochromatin increases spurious transcription of repetitive elements and induces features of alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT). TLK depletion culminates in a cGAS-STING-TBK1-mediated innate immune response that is independent of replication-stress signaling and attenuated by the depletion of factors required to produce extra-telomeric DNA.

EllipTrack first implements a global track-linking algorithm to construct tracks that maximize the probability of cell lineages. Tracking mistakes are then corrected with a local track-correction module in which tracks generated by the global algorithm are systematically examined and amended if a more probable alternative can be found. Through benchmarking, we show that EllipTrack outperforms state-of-the-art cell trackers and generates nearly error-free cell lineages for multiple large-scale movies.

Upon loss of TRIP12, elevated PARPi-induced PARP1 trapping causes increased DNA replication stress, DNA damage, cell cycle arrest, and cell death. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that TRIP12 binds PARP1 via a central PAR-binding WWE domain and, using its carboxy-terminal HECT domain, catalyzes polyubiquitylation of PARP1, triggering proteasomal degradation and preventing supra-physiological PARP1 accumulation. Further, in cohorts of breast and ovarian cancer patients, PARP1 abundance is negatively correlated with TRIP12 expression. We thus propose TRIP12 as regulator of PARP1 stability and PARPi-induced PARP trapping, with potential implications for PARPi sensitivity and resistance.",7,13.0,"{""Complex"": 1, ""Activation"": 6}"

We confirm that liver pyruvate cycling fluxes are incongruent between different 13C tracers in models with conventional assumptions. When models are expanded to include more labeling measurements and fewer constraining assumptions, however, liver pyruvate cycling is significant, and inconsistencies in hepatic flux estimates using [13C3]lactate and [13C3]propionate isotopes emanate, in part, from peripheral tracer recycling and incomplete isotope equilibration within the citric acid cycle.",0,0.0,{}

We find that decreased β-globin is sufficient to induce robust re-expression of γ-globin, and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of differentiating isogenic erythroid precursors implicates ATF4 as a causal regulator of this response. ATF4 binds within the HBS1L-MYB intergenic enhancer and regulates expression of MYB, a known γ-globin regulator.

Reconstitution of MZ-deficient CD19ko mice shows that ACKR3- MZBs can differentiate into ACKR3+ MZBs, but not vice versa. The lack of a MZ is rescued by adoptive transfer of ACKR3-sufficient, and less by ACKR3-deficient, follicular B cells (FoBs); hence, ACKR3 expression is crucial for establishment of the MZ. The inability of CD19ko mice to respond to T-independent antigen is rescued when ACKR3-proficient, but not ACKR3-deficient, FoBs are transferred.

Elevated dNTP/nucleotide triphosphate (NTP) ratios in Δlon cells protects them from deletion of otherwise essential deoxythymidine triphosphate (dTTP)-producing pathways and shields them from hydroxyurea-induced loss of dNTPs. Increased dNTP production in Δlon results from higher expression of ribonucleotide reductase driven by increased CcrM. We show that misfolded proteins can stabilize CcrM by competing for limited protease and that Lon-dependent control of dNTPs improves fitness during protein misfolding conditions.

32763910,"Identifying modifiers of dosage-sensitive genes involved in neurodegenerative disorders is imperative to discover novel genetic risk factors and potential therapeutic entry points. In this study, we focus on Ataxin-1 (ATXN1), a dosage-sensitive gene involved in the neurodegenerative disease spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1). While the precise maintenance of ATXN1 levels is essential to prevent disease, the mechanisms that regulate ATXN1 expression remain largely unknown. We demonstrate that ATXN1's unusually long 5' untranslated region (5' UTR) negatively regulates its expression via posttranscriptional mechanisms. Based on recent reports that microRNAs (miRNAs) can interact with both 3' and 5' UTRs to regulate their target genes, we identify miR760 as a negative regulator that binds to a conserved site in ATXN1's 5' UTR to induce RNA degradation and translational inhibition. We found that delivery of Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-expressing miR760 in the cerebellum reduces ATXN1 levels in vivo and mitigates motor coordination deficits in a mouse model of SCA1. These findings provide new insights into the regulation of ATXN1 levels, present additional evidence for miRNA-mediated gene regulation via 5' UTR binding, and raise the possibility that noncoding mutations in the ATXN1 locus may act as risk factors for yet to be discovered progressive ataxias.",1,1.5,"{""Inhibition"": 1}"

Pursuit of this question, by high resolution 3D fluorescence imaging of living and fixed mammalian cells, has led to three discoveries. First, we show that the structural axes of separated sister chromatids are linked by evenly spaced ""mini-axis"" bridges. Second, when chromosomes first emerge as discrete units, at prophase, they are organized as co-oriented sister linear loop arrays emanating from a conjoined axis. We show that this same basic organization persists throughout mitosis, without helical coiling. Third, from prophase onward, chromosomes are deformed into sequential arrays of half-helical segments of alternating handedness (perversions), accompanied by correlated kinks. These arrays fluctuate dynamically over <15 s timescales.

This change in length does not result from reduced AIS plasticity, as prolonged depolarization induces changes in AIS length independent of genotype. However, depolarization does reduce cellular excitability, the magnitude of which is greater in Fmr1-/y neurons. Finally, we observe reduced functional inputs from the entorhinal cortex, with no genotypic difference in the firing rates of CA1 pyramidal neurons. This suggests that AIS-dependent hyperexcitability in Fmr1-/y mice may result from adaptive or homeostatic regulation induced by reduced functional synaptic connectivity.

The mRNA binding protein CPEB2 strongly binds Hsp90 via its prion domain. In a yeast model, transient inhibition of Hsp90 results in persistent activation of a CPEB translation reporter even in the absence of exogenous CPEB that persists for 30 generations after the inhibitor is removed. Ribosomal profiling reveals that some endogenous yeast mRNAs, including HAC1, show a persistent change in translation efficiency following transient Hsp90 inhibition.

FOXK1-53BP1 interaction is significantly enhanced upon DNA damage during the S phase in an ATM/CHK2-dependent manner, which reduces the association of 53BP1 with its downstream factors RIF1 and PTIP. Depletion of FOXK1 impairs DNA repair and induces compromised cell survival upon DNA damage. Overexpression of FOXK1 diminishes 53BP1 foci formation, which leads to resistance to PARPis and elevation of HR in BRCA1-deficient cells and decreased telomere fusion in TRF2-depleted cells.

Several studies reported that the CDK inhibitor p27Kip1 promotes starvation-induced autophagy by an unknown mechanism. Here we find that p27 controls autophagy via an mTORC1-dependent mechanism in amino acid-deprived cells. During prolonged starvation, a fraction of p27 is recruited to lysosomes, where it interacts with LAMTOR1, a component of the Ragulator complex required for mTORC1 activation. Binding of p27 to LAMTOR1 prevents Ragulator assembly and mTORC1 activation, promoting autophagy. Conversely, p27-/- cells exhibit elevated mTORC1 signalling as well as impaired lysosomal activity and autophagy. This is associated with cytoplasmic sequestration of TFEB, preventing induction of the lysosomal genes required for lysosome function. LAMTOR1 silencing or mTOR inhibition restores autophagy and induces apoptosis in p27-/- cells. Together, these results reveal a direct coordinated regulation between the cell cycle and cell growth machineries.",9,14.0,"{""Inhibition"": 7, ""Complex"": 1, ""Activation"": 1}"

Here we model the problem using X-chromosome inactivation by developing ""BioRBP"", an enzymatic RNA-proteomic method that enables probing of low-abundance interactions and an allelic RNA-depletion and -tagging system. We identify messenger RNA-decapping enzyme 1A (DCP1A) as a key regulator of Tsix, a noncoding RNA implicated in allelic choice through X-chromosome pairing. DCP1A controls Tsix half-life and transcription elongation. Depleting DCP1A causes accumulation of X-X pairs and perturbs the transition to monoallelic Tsix expression required for Xist upregulation. While ablating DCP1A causes hyperpairing, forcing Tsix degradation resolves pairing and enables Xist upregulation. We link pairing to allelic partitioning of CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) and show that tethering DCP1A to one Tsix allele is sufficient to drive monoallelic Xist expression. Thus, DCP1A flips a bistable switch for the mutually exclusive determination of active and inactive Xs.",0,0.0,{}

Here we report that lipid-raft microdomains are essential components of phagolysosomal membranes of macrophages and depend on flotillins. Genetic deletion of flotillins demonstrates that the assembly of both major defense complexes vATPase and NADPH oxidase requires membrane microdomains. Furthermore, we describe a virulence mechanism leading to dysregulation of membrane microdomains by melanized wild-type conidia of the important human-pathogenic fungus Aspergillus fumigatus resulting in reduced phagolysosomal acidification. We show that phagolysosomes with ingested melanized conidia contain a reduced amount of free Ca2+ ions and that inhibition of Ca2+-dependent calmodulin activity led to reduced lipid-raft formation. We identify a single-nucleotide polymorphism in the human FLOT1 gene resulting in heightened susceptibility for invasive aspergillosis in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients.

Using time-lapse microscopy and isotope labeling, we show that these proteins reversibly transition between punctate structures at night and a soluble state during the day without substantial degradation. We find that the cyanobacterial circadian clock regulates the kinetics of puncta formation during the night and that the appearance of puncta indicates the metabolic status of the cell. Reversible condensation of specific enzymes is thus a regulated response to the day-night cycle and may reflect a general bacterial strategy used in fluctuating growth conditions.",0,0.0,{}

Molecular dynamics simulations predict the favorable interactions of these synthetic compounds with the viral lipid membrane, where the epitope of the HIV-1 glycoprotein Env is located. Chemical modification of 10E8 with aromatic acetamides facilitates the productive and specific recognition of the native antigen, partially buried in the crowded environment of the viral membrane, resulting in a dramatic increase of its capacity to block viral infection.

Here, we show that although the loss of cap-specific m6Am in mice does not affect viability or fertility, the Pcif1 mutants display reduced body weight. Transcriptome analyses of mutant mouse tissues support a role for the cap-specific m6Am modification in stabilizing transcripts. In contrast, the Drosophila Pcif1 is catalytically dead, but like its mammalian counterpart, it retains the ability to associate with the Ser5-phosphorylated CTD of RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II). Finally, we show that the Trypanosoma Pcif1 is an m6Am methylase that contributes to the N6,N6,2'-O-trimethyladenosine (m62Am) in the hypermethylated cap4 structure of trypanosomatids.

Combining computational modeling and in vivo analyses with an immobile Chordin construct, we demonstrate that long-range Chordin diffusion is not necessary for BMP gradient formation and DV patterning.

Strikingly, VGLUT1-deficient synapses exhibited abnormal synaptic failures within a few seconds during high-frequency repetitive firing, which was recapitulated by manipulating presynaptic Cl- concentrations to retard SV refilling.

Aβ toxicity is mediated by Fyn kinase in a tau-dependent process; however, whether Fyn controls tau pathology in diseases that lack Aβ pathology remains unexplored. To address this, we generate the Tg/Fyn-/- mouse, which couples mutant tau overexpression with Fyn knockout. Surprisingly, Tg/Fyn-/- mice exhibit a near-complete ablation of NFTs, alongside reduced tau hyperphosphorylation, altered tau solubility, and diminished synaptic tau accumulation. Furthermore, Tg/Fyn-/- brain lysates elicit less tau seeding in tau biosensor cells. Lastly, the fibrillization of tau is boosted by its pseudophosphorylation at the Fyn epitope Y18.

Mice lacking CB1Rs in D1-positive cells (D1-CB1-KO) display impairment in long-term, but not short-term, novel object recognition memory (NOR). Re-expression of CB1Rs in hippocampal D1R-positive cells rescues this NOR deficit. Learning induces an enhancement of in vivo hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), which is absent in mutant mice.

In Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) subgroup medulloblastoma, aberrant activation of SHH signaling causes increased proliferation of granule neuron progenitors (GNPs), and predisposes these cells to tumorigenesis. A second, cooperating genetic hit is often required to push these hyperplastic cells to malignancy and confer mutation-specific characteristics associated with oncogenic signaling. Somatic loss-of-function mutations of the transcriptional corepressor BCOR are recurrent and enriched in SHH medulloblastoma. To investigate BCOR as a putative tumor suppressor, we used a genetically engineered mouse model to delete exons 9/10 of Bcor (BcorΔE9-10 ) in GNPs during development. This mutation leads to reduced expression of C-terminally truncated BCOR (BCORΔE9-10). While BcorΔE9-10 alone did not promote tumorigenesis or affect GNP differentiation, BcorΔE9-10 combined with loss of the SHH receptor gene Ptch1 resulted in fully penetrant medulloblastomas. In Ptch1+/- ;BcorΔE9-10 tumors, the growth factor gene Igf2 was aberrantly up-regulated, and ectopic Igf2 overexpression was sufficient to drive tumorigenesis in Ptch1+/- GNPs.

In clinical samples, E-cadherin-expressing and -deficient tumours both invade collectively and metastasize equally, implicating additional mechanisms controlling cell-cell cooperation and individualization. Here, using spatially defined organotypic culture, intravital microscopy of mammary tumours in mice and in silico modelling, we identify cell density regulation by three-dimensional tissue boundaries to physically control collective movement irrespective of the composition and stability of cell-cell junctions. Deregulation of adherens junctions by downregulation of E-cadherin and p120-catenin resulted in a transition from coordinated to uncoordinated collective movement along extracellular boundaries, whereas single-cell escape depended on locally free tissue space.

FBXL7 mediates the ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of active c-SRC after its phosphorylation at Ser 104. The DNA-demethylating agent decitabine recovers FBXL7 expression and limits epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and cell invasion in a c-SRC-dependent manner. In vivo, FBXL7-depleted cancer cells form tumours with a high metastatic burden. Silencing of c-SRC or treatment with the c-SRC inhibitor dasatinib together with FBXL7 depletion prevents metastases. Furthermore, decitabine reduces metastases derived from prostate and pancreatic cancer cells in a FBXL7-dependent manner.

However, only a subset of patients achieves durable responses, suggesting that the mechanisms of the immune checkpoint pathways are not completely understood. Here, we report that PD-L1 translocates from the plasma membrane into the nucleus through interactions with components of the endocytosis and nucleocytoplasmic transport pathways, regulated by p300-mediated acetylation and HDAC2-dependent deacetylation of PD-L1. Moreover, PD-L1 deficiency leads to compromised expression of multiple immune-response-related genes. Genetically or pharmacologically modulating PD-L1 acetylation blocks its nuclear translocation, reprograms the expression of immune-response-related genes and, as a consequence, enhances the anti-tumour response to PD-1 blockade.

We find that, of six commonly deployed VH sequences, only those CDRs encoded by IGHV1-2∗02 enable polyclonal antibody responses against bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) when introduced to the bloodstream. The LPS is from diverse strains of gram-negative bacteria, and the VH-gene-dependent responses are directed against the non-variable and universal saccrolipid substructure of this antigen.

Passive sound exposure shows that the cortical representations of two sound features, pure tone and frequency-modulated sweep (FMS), are not influencing each other. Enhancing inhibition before the critical period for pure tone accelerates it without changing the critical period for FMS. Similarly, delaying the critical period for pure tone with white noise exposure has no effect on the critical period for FMS.

Zebrafish lacking functional Tp53 display increased indicators of cardiomyocyte proliferation during regeneration, whereas transgenic Mdm2 blockade inhibits injury-induced cardiomyocyte proliferation. Induced myocardial overexpression of the mitogenic factors Nrg1 or Vegfaa in the absence of injury also upregulates mdm2 and suppresses Tp53 levels, and tp53 mutations augment the mitogenic effects of Nrg1. mdm2 induction is spatiotemporally associated with markers of de-differentiation in injury and growth contexts, suggesting a broad role in cardiogenesis.

Spatiotemporal analysis of M18B throughout cardiomyogenesis and myofibrillogenesis reveals that this structural myosin undergoes nuclear-cytoplasmic redistribution during myogenic differentiation, where its incorporation within muscle stress fibers coincides with actin striation onset. Furthermore, this analysis shows that M18B is directly integrated within the muscle myosin thick filament during myofibril maturation.

We find that the OSCP C141S mutation confers resistance to PTP opening and cell death by diamide and MitoParaquat only when cyclophilin D (CyPD) has been ablated, a protective role that can be explained by CyPD shielding C141 from oxidants. The mutation decreases apoptosis in zebrafish embryos, indicating that this OSCP residue is involved in development. Site-directed mutagenesis in yeast suggests that other conserved cysteines in the α, γ, and c subunits of F-ATP synthase are not involved in PTP modulation.

We have found that the loss of function of ETAA1, an ATR activator, and RIF1 reduce the sensitivity to CDC7is by allowing DNA synthesis to occur more efficiently, notably during late S phase. We show that partial CDC7 inhibition induces ATR mainly through ETAA1, and that if ATR is subsequently inhibited, origin firing is unleashed in a CDK- and CDC7-dependent manner.

In addition, whisker-dependent behaviors that are initially impaired by single-whisker experience (SWE) rapidly recover when associated cortical regions remap. Cross-linking the surface GluA2 subunit of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) suppresses the expression of w-Pot, presumably by blocking AMPAR surface diffusion, in mice with all whiskers intact, indicating that synaptic potentiation in vivo requires AMPAR trafficking.

We show that S1459 is a CaMKIIα phosphorylation site, and that endogenous phosphorylation is regulated during development and in response to synaptic activity in a dark rearing model. GluN2A-S1459 phosphorylation results in preferential binding of NMDARs to SNX27 and a corresponding decrease in PSD-95 binding, which consequently regulates NMDAR trafficking. Furthermore, the epilepsy-associated GluN2A-S1459G variant displays defects in interactions with both SNX27 and PSD-95, resulting in trafficking deficits, reduced spine density, and decreased excitatory synaptic transmission.

CRISPR-Cas9 technology represents a promising platform for achieving this goal. Truncation of guide RNA (gRNA) from the 5' end enables the application of a nuclease competent Cas9 protein for transcriptional modulation of genes, allowing multifunctionality of CRISPR. Here, we introduce an enhanced CRISPR-based transcriptional repressor to reprogram immune homeostasis in vivo. In this repressor system, two transcriptional repressors-heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1a) and Krüppel-associated box (KRAB)-are fused to the MS2 coat protein and subsequently recruited by gRNA aptamer binding to a nuclease competent CRISPR complex containing truncated gRNAs. With the enhanced repressor, we demonstrate transcriptional repression of the Myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (Myd88) gene in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrate that this strategy can efficiently downregulate Myd88 expression in lung, blood and bone marrow of Cas9 transgenic mice that receive systemic injection of adeno-associated virus (AAV)2/1-carrying truncated gRNAs targeting Myd88 and the MS2-HP1a-KRAB cassette. This downregulation is accompanied by changes in downstream signalling elements such as TNF-α and ICAM-1. Myd88 repression leads to a decrease in immunoglobulin G (IgG) production against AAV2/1 and AAV2/9 and this strategy modulates the IgG response against AAV cargos. It improves the efficiency of a subsequent AAV9/CRISPR treatment for repression of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), a gene that, when repressed, can lower blood cholesterol levels. We also demonstrate that CRISPR-mediated Myd88 repression can act as a prophylactic measure against septicaemia in both Cas9 transgenic and C57BL/6J mice. When delivered by nanoparticles, this repressor can serve as a therapeutic modality to influence the course of septicaemia. Collectively, we report that CRISPR-mediated repression of endogenous Myd88 can effectively modulate the host immune response against AAV-mediated gene therapy and influence the course of septicaemia.

We show that all of the nAbs bind in close proximity to known bnAb epitopes and might therefore sterically hinder elicitation of bnAbs. We also identify a ""public clonotype"" that targets the immunodominant C3/V5 nAb epitope, which suggests that common antibody rearrangements might help determine humoral responses to Env immunogens.

Cholinergic neurons, which are especially affected in some pathologies, have recently been shown to exhibit HSP mediated by nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). In Drosophila central neurons, pharmacological blockade of activity induces a homeostatic response mediated by the Drosophila α7 (Dα7) nAChR, which is tuned by a subsequent increase in expression of the voltage-dependent Kv4/Shal channel. Here, we show that an in vivo reduction of cholinergic signaling induces HSP mediated by Dα7 nAChRs, and this upregulation of Dα7 itself is sufficient to trigger transcriptional activation, mediated by nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), of the Kv4/Shal gene, revealing a receptor-ion channel system coupled for homeostatic tuning in cholinergic neurons.",2,0.0,"{""Activation"": 2}"

Whether these two E3s cross-talk with each other was previously unknown. Here, we report that SAG competes with APC2 for UBE2C/UBE2S binding to act as a potential endogenous inhibitor of APC/C, thereby regulating the G2-to-M progression. As such, SAG knockdown triggers premature activation of APC/C, leading to mitotic slippage and resistance to anti-microtubule drugs. On the other hand, SAG itself is a substrate of APC/CCDH1 for targeted degradation at the G1 phase. The degradation-resistant mutant of SAG-R98A/L101A accelerates the G1-to-S progression.

Atf-6 loss confers longevity via downregulation of the ER calcium buffer, calreticulin. ER calcium release via the inositol triphosphate receptor (IP3R/itr-1) is required for longevity, while IP3R/itr-1 gain of function is sufficient to extend lifespan. Highlighting coordination between organelles, the mitochondrial calcium import channel mcu-1 is also required for atf-6 longevity. IP3R inhibition leads to impaired mitochondrial bioenergetics and hyperfusion, which is sufficient to suppress long life in atf-6 mutants.

Trans-omics analysis reveals that the downstream activity of PpAN3 is linked to arginine metabolism. Elevating arginine level by chemical treatment leads to stunted gametophores and causes Ppan3 mutant-like transcriptional changes in the wild-type plant. Furthermore, ectopic expression of AtAN3 from Arabidopsis thaliana ameliorates the defective arginine metabolism and promotes gametophore formation in Ppan3 mutants.

In vivo tracing with 13C-labeled glucose in the mouse shows that glucose in bone is readily metabolized to lactate but not organic acids in the TCA cycle. Glucose tracing in osteoblast cultures reveals that pyruvate is carboxylated to form malate integral to the malate-aspartate shuttle. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) identifies Me2, encoding the mitochondrial NAD-dependent isoform of malic enzyme, as being specifically upregulated during osteoblast differentiation.

Strikingly, we find that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) targeting leads to primary tumor shrinkage, but it increases intra-tumor hypoxia, resulting in a higher CTC cluster shedding rate and metastasis formation. Conversely, pro-angiogenic treatment increases primary tumor size, yet it dramatically suppresses the formation of CTC clusters and metastasis.

Here, we discover that the SAV1 WW tandem containing a short Pro-rich extension immediately following the WW tandem (termed as ""WW12ex"") forms a highly stable homodimer. The crystal structure of SAV1 WW12ex reveals that the Pro-rich extension of one subunit binds to both WW domains from the other subunit. Thus, SAV1 WW12ex forms a domain-swapped dimer instead of a WW2 homodimerization-mediated dimer.

In a murine model, we find that the chemokines CXCL1 and CCL2 are induced in the brain following HSV-1 infection. Ccr2 (CCL2 receptor)-deficient mice have reduced monocyte recruitment, uncontrolled viral replication, and increased morbidity. Contrastingly, Cxcr2 (CXCL1 receptor)-deficient mice exhibit markedly reduced neutrophil recruitment, BBB permeability, and morbidity, without influencing viral load. CXCL1 is produced by astrocytes in response to HSV-1 and by astrocytes and neurons in response to IL-1α, and it is the critical ligand required for neutrophil transendothelial migration, which correlates with BBB breakdown. Thus, the CXCL1-CXCR2 axis represents an attractive therapeutic target to limit neutrophil-mediated morbidity in HSV-1 encephalitis.",0,0.0,{}
32937135,"FBXL21 is a clock-controlled E3 ligase modulating circadian periodicity via subcellular-specific CRYPTOCHROME degradation. How FBXL21 regulates tissue-specific circadian physiology and what mechanism operates upstream is poorly understood. Here we report the sarcomere component TCAP as a cytoplasmic substrate of FBXL21. FBXL21 interacts with TCAP in a circadian manner antiphasic to TCAP accumulation in skeletal muscle, and circadian TCAP oscillation is disrupted in Psttm mice with an Fbxl21 hypomorph mutation. GSK-3β phosphorylates FBXL21 and TCAP to activate FBXL21-mediated, phosphodegron-dependent TCAP degradation. GSK-3β inhibition or knockdown diminishes FBXL21-Cul1 complex formation and delays FBXL21-mediated TCAP degradation. Finally, Psttm mice show significant skeletal muscle defects, including impaired fiber size, exercise tolerance, grip strength, and response to glucocorticoid-induced atrophy, in conjunction with cardiac dysfunction. These data highlight a circadian regulatory pathway where a GSK-3β-FBXL21 functional axis controls TCAP degradation via SCF complex formation and regulates skeletal muscle function.",7,16.5,"{""Activation"": 3, ""Inhibition"": 1, ""Phosphorylation"": 2, ""Complex"": 1}"
32937136,"PRC2 creates the repressive mark histone H3 Lys27 trimethylation. Although PRC2 is involved in various biological processes, its role in glial development remains ambiguous. Here, we show that PRC2 is required for oligodendrocyte (OL) differentiation and myelination, but not for OL precursor formation. PRC2-deficient OL lineage cells differentiate into OL precursors, but they fail to trigger the molecular program for myelination, highlighting that PRC2 is essential for directing the differentiation timing of OL precursors. PRC2 null OL lineage cells aberrantly induce Notch pathway genes and acquire astrocytic features. The repression of the Notch pathway restores the myelination program and inhibits abnormal astrocytic differentiation in the PRC2-deficient OL lineage, indicating that Notch is a major target of PRC2. Altogether, our studies propose a specific action of PRC2 as a novel gatekeeper that determines the glial fate choice and the timing of OL lineage progression and myelination by impinging on the Notch pathway.",3,0.0,"{""Activation"": 3}"
32937137,"Retinal bipolar cells (BCs) connect with photoreceptors and relay visual information to retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Retina-specific deletion of Lhx4 in mice results in a visual defect resembling human congenital stationary night blindness. This visual dysfunction results from the absence of rod bipolar cells (RBCs) and the loss of selective rod-connecting cone bipolar cell (CBC) subtypes and AII amacrine cells (ACs). Inactivation of Lhx4 causes the apoptosis of BCs and cell fate switch from some BCs to ACs, whereas Lhx4 overexpression promotes BC genesis. Moreover, Lhx4 positively regulates Lhx3 expression to drive the fate choice of type 2 BCs over the GABAergic ACs. Lhx4 inactivation ablates Bhlhe23 expression, whereas overexpression of Bhlhe23 partially rescues RBC development in the absence of Lhx4. Thus, by acting upstream of Bhlhe23, Prdm8, Fezf2, Lhx3, and other BC genes, Lhx4, together with Isl1, could play essential roles in regulating the subtype-specific development of RBCs and CBCs.",5,13.5,"{""IncreaseAmount"": 1, ""Activation"": 4}"
32937138,"The ""omnigenic"" model of the genetic architecture of complex traits proposed two categories of causal genes: core and peripheral. Core genes are hypothesized to directly regulate disease and may serve as therapeutic targets. Using a cell-type- and time-point-specific gene co-expression network for mineralizing osteoblasts, we identify a co-expression module enriched for genes implicated by bone mineral density (BMD) genome-wide association studies (GWASs), correlated with in vitro osteoblast mineralization and associated with skeletal phenotypes in human monogenic disease and mouse knockouts. Four genes from this module (B4GALNT3, CADM1, DOCK9, and GPR133) are located within the BMD GWAS loci with colocalizing expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and exhibit altered BMD in mouse knockouts, suggesting that they are causal genetic drivers of BMD in humans. Our network-based approach identifies a ""core"" module for BMD and provides a resource for expanding our understanding of the genetics of bone mass.",0,0.0,{}
32937139,"Phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2α is a rapid and vital response to many forms of stress, including protein-misfolding stress in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER stress). It is believed to cause a general reduction in protein synthesis while enabling translation of few transcripts. Such a reduction of protein synthesis comes with the threat of depleting essential proteins, a risk thought to be mitigated by its transient nature. Here, we find that translation attenuation is not uniform, with cytosolic and mitochondrial ribosomal subunits being prominently downregulated. Translation attenuation of these targets persists after translation recovery. Surprisingly, this occurs without a measurable decrease in ribosomal proteins. Explaining this conundrum, translation attenuation preferentially targets long-lived proteins, a finding not only demonstrated by ribosomal proteins but also observed at a global level. This shows that protein stability buffers the cost of translational attenuation, establishing an evolutionary principle of cellular robustness.",0,0.0,{}
32937140,"Cyclin D1 encodes the regulatory subunit of a holoenzyme that phosphorylates RB and functions as a collaborative nuclear oncogene. The serine threonine kinase Akt plays a pivotal role in the control of cellular metabolism, survival, and mitogenic signaling. Herein, Akt1-mediated phosphorylation of downstream substrates in the mammary gland is reduced by cyclin D1 genetic deletion and is induced by mammary-gland-targeted cyclin D1 overexpression. Cyclin D1 is associated with Akt1 and augments the rate of onset and maximal cellular Akt1 activity induced by mitogens. Cyclin D1 is identified in a cytoplasmic-membrane-associated pool, and cytoplasmic-membrane-localized cyclin D1-but not nuclear-localized cyclin D1-recapitulates Akt1 transcriptional function. These studies identify a novel extranuclear function of cyclin D1 to enhance proliferative functions via augmenting Akt1 phosphorylation at Ser473.",1,1.5,"{""Activation"": 1}"
32937141,"SETD1A encodes a histone methyltransferase whose de novo mutations are identified in schizophrenia (SCZ) patients and confer a large increase in disease risk. Here, we generate Setd1a mutant mice carrying the frameshift mutation that closely mimics a loss-of-function variant of SCZ. Our Setd1a (+/-) mice display various behavioral abnormalities relevant to features of SCZ, impaired excitatory synaptic transmission in layer 2/3 (L2/3) pyramidal neurons of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and altered expression of diverse genes related to neurodevelopmental disorders and synaptic functions in the mPFC. RNAi-mediated Setd1a knockdown (KD) specifically in L2/3 pyramidal neurons of the mPFC only recapitulates impaired sociality among multiple behavioral abnormalities of Setd1a (+/-) mice. Optogenetics-assisted selective stimulation of presynaptic neurons combined with Setd1a KD reveals that Setd1a at postsynaptic site is essential for excitatory synaptic transmission. Our findings suggest that reduced SETD1A may attenuate excitatory synaptic function and contribute to the pathophysiology of SCZ.",0,0.0,{}
32937142,"Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are important for response to infection and for immune development in early life. HIV infection in adults depletes circulating ILCs, but the impact on children infected from birth remains unknown. We study vertically HIV-infected children from birth to adulthood and find severe and persistent depletion of all circulating ILCs that, unlike CD4+ T cells, are not restored by long-term antiretroviral therapy unless initiated at birth. Remaining ILCs upregulate genes associated with cellular activation and metabolic perturbation. Unlike HIV-infected adults, ILCs are also profoundly depleted in tonsils of vertically infected children. Transcriptional profiling of remaining ILCs reveals ongoing cell-type-specific activity despite antiretroviral therapy. Collectively, these data suggest an important and ongoing role for ILCs in lymphoid tissue of HIV-infected children from birth, where persistent depletion and sustained transcriptional activity are likely to have long-term immune consequences that merit further investigation.",0,0.0,{}
